<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="dcapi"><span class="dcap">I</span></span>N almost every part of Europe the tales current
among the common people have been of late
years diligently sought out, and carefully collected.
Variants of them pour in profusely every year. But it does
not seem probable that any entirely new stories will be discovered
in any European land. Nor is it likely that in
fresh variants of the longer and apparently more artificial
tales, any quite new incidents, or even any unquestionably
novel features, will be found. The harvest has been abundant,
its chief fruits are now stored, and the work which is
still going on among the gleaners, although in itself good and
praiseworthy, may be regarded without the excitement of
eager hope. The task of the present seems to be, not so
much the garnering of European folk-tales, as their comparison
and elucidation, and, so far as possible, their explanation.
But in many cases they do not appear to contain in themselves
the ingredients which are necessary for their resolution
into their primary elements. Nor do the records of the
lands in which they exist always supply what is wanted.
The &ldquo;fairy tales&rdquo; of Europe throw very little light upon,
are but slightly illuminated by, the histories of the widely
differing lands in which they so closely resemble each other.
And the most interesting among them, those which appear
most clearly to bear witness to their being embodiments of
mythological ideas, or expansions of moral precepts, seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>viii]</a></span>
to be but little in keeping with what we know of the sentiments
and beliefs of the heathen ancestors of the villagers
in whose memories they have been for so many centuries
retained. Among such tales of this kind, for instance, as
linger on in our own islands, there is but little to be found
which can be looked upon as a specially characteristic
deposit left by the waves of Iberian, Celtic, and Teutonic
population which have successively passed over the face of
the land. This statement does not, of course, hold good in
the case of such legends about national heroes as Mr. J.&nbsp;F.
Campbell has found thriving in Ireland and the West Highlands
of Scotland, and which he justly believes to be &ldquo;bardic
recitations, fast disappearing, and changing into prose.&rdquo;
They belong to a different section of popular fiction from
that to which reference is now made. It is often difficult
to draw the line between these two classes of folk-tales.
But there is a striking difference between the typical representatives
of the two divisions, between cosmopolitan
novelettes like Cinderella or the Sleeping Beauty, on the
one hand, and pseudo-historic legends about local heroes
on the other. It is unfortunate that we do not possess a
sufficiency of accurate designations for the numerous species
of the genus folk-tale. Their existence would prevent much
misapprehension. But in their absence, a discusser of
popular tales should take pains to define precisely to what
tribe, family, or group of stories his remarks are intended to
apply.</p>

<p>There are to be found, in all European lands, certain tales
which are of a more complex structure than the rest, which
appear to have been constructed by a skilled workman, to
be artificial productions rather than natural growths. It is
only with such stories as these that we have at present to
deal. These novelettes or comediettas, as they may be
called, of the European common people, differ but little in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>ix]</a></span>
their essential parts, whether they are recited in the cold
north or the balmy south, the rude east or the cultured
west. Their openings, it is true, vary with their localities;
but in the main body of the tale, not only does the same
leading idea pervade all the variants, but also the same
sequence of events leads up in almost every case to the
same termination. To this class of stories belong nearly all
the tales which, under considerably modified forms, have
naturalized themselves in the nurseries of Europe. In it
are comprised many popular fictions, on the obscurer parts
of which a quite insufficient light is thrown by researches
among the manners and mythologies of old European
heathenism.</p>

<p>It is upon such stories as these that a kindly light beams
with the greatest advantage from Asia. Very similar stories
have been preserved in the memories of the common people
in many parts of Asia, but especially in India. And their
leading ideas are perfectly in accordance with the mythology
or the moral teaching of the Asiatics who, age after age,
have delighted in telling or hearing them. In such cases
as these it seems to be not very unreasonable to suppose
that the story was originally, if not created, at all events
shaped and trimmed in Asia, and thence was afterwards
conveyed from lip to lip into Europe. Such universal
favourites as Beauty and the Beast and Puss in Boots may
be confidently cited as oriental fictions which have taken
possession of European minds. There is a rich store of
other popular fictions, which may be left to be accounted
for according to the two principal methods of interpretation
in vogue. They may be explained as independent developments
of mythological germs common to the ancestors of
the various Aryan peoples of Europe. Or they may be
regarded as embodiments of certain ideas common to
savages of all races. It will be sufficient to deal at present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>x]</a></span>
with the more limited, but better known class, to which
special attention has been called.</p>

<p>Among the Asiatic folk-tales which seem likely to assist
in their explanation, none are more copious or more useful
than those of India. There the old religion has maintained
itself with which so many of these stories are linked, and
there the moral teaching still prevails which made its voice
heard in other tales of the far-off time when they first became
current. Any collection of genuine Indian Fairy Tales is
therefore certain to be, not only of interest to the general
reader, but also of real value to the specialist who devotes
himself to the comparison of folk-tales. The collection
now before us has great merits of its own. The stories
have been told in Hind&uacute;st&aacute;n&iacute; to the very young collector
by two ayahs, who are both Hind&uacute;s, and by a Muhammadan
man-servant. In this respect Miss Stokes&rsquo;s contribution
to our knowledge of India differs from the very similar,
and very charming, work by Miss Frere, &ldquo;Old Deccan
Days,&rdquo; the stories in which were told by an ayah who was,
as her father and grandfather had been, a native Christian.
The two books ought to be compared with each other. No
possessor of the one ought to be without the other. All the
stories contained in the present volume, as we learn from the
notes, have been read back by the young collector to the
tellers in Hind&uacute;st&aacute;n&iacute; after they were told, and a second time
by the annotator before they were printed. &ldquo;I never saw
people more anxious to have their tales retold exactly, than
are Dunkn&iacute; and M&uacute;niy&aacute;,&rdquo; the two story-telling ayahs. Not
till each tale was pronounced by them to be exact was it sent
to the press. The stories may be taken then as faithful transcripts
of Indian thought. The merits of the copious Notes
contributed by the late Mrs. Whitley Stokes, bearing witness
to a very wide range of reading, and to a most intelligent
use of the authorities referred to, will be fully acknowledged
by all who have had occasion to explore the regions from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xi]</a></span>
which she has gathered so much valuable information.
Throughout the whole of the work thus conscientiously
compiled and intelligently annotated, there will be found
scattered, in addition to its other merits, many a parallel
with our own popular tales, many an illustration or explanation
of their meaning&mdash;a ray of light shot here or there
which illumines their dark places, and may enable the explorers
of their mystic domains to avoid stumbles which
are often somewhat mortifying. It remains only to point
out a few of the most important passages.</p>


<p class="hrpad">Some of the stories in this volume are so thoroughly
oriental, so little in accordance with western thought or feeling,
that they have not found an echo among ourselves; their
counterparts are not to be found naturalized in European
lands. Of such a kind are the legends, taken from literary
sources, of &ldquo;The Upright King,&rdquo; and of &ldquo;R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand&rsquo;s
Punishment,&rdquo; in which the patience of a religious monarch
is tried as was that of Job, and comes out from the trial
equally victorious. The sorrows of Patient Grissel have met
with sympathy in many lands, for meekness has ever been
considered a womanly virtue. But the heroism of a husband
and father who sells his wife to a merchant, and his
son to a cowherd, in order that he may be able to keep his
promise to a holy mendicant, and bestow upon him two
pounds and a half of gold, can scarcely be expected to invest
itself, to western eyes, with the air of a manly virtue. In
the same way, the great sitting powers displayed by King
Burtal, who never once moves from his seat in the jungle
for twelve whole years, during which space of time he
neither eats nor drinks, and thereby elevates himself to the
dignity of a fak&iacute;r, are not of a kind to elicit the sympathies
or command the admiration of nations addicted to active
exercise.</p>

<p>The explanation of N&aacute;naks&aacute;&rsquo;s thrice repeated laugh, also,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xii]</a></span>
could retain its vitality only in an atmosphere pervaded by
a belief in the transmigration of souls. Buddhistic apologues
have sometimes passed into legends of Christian Saints.
But it would be difficult to perform the operation in the
case of an account of how a woman, who had tormented
to death her husband&rsquo;s sister, was justly punished by the
reappearance in the world of the ill-used sister-in-law, in
the form of that unkind woman&rsquo;s exceedingly peevish baby
daughter. Numerous, also, as are European stories about
ogres, vampires, and other demoniacal cannibals, we shall
not readily find a western counterpart of the terrible tale,
in No. <a href="#Page_173">24</a>, of the &ldquo;Rakshas&rdquo; which sometimes appears as a
goat, and sometimes as a most beautiful young girl, dressed
in grand clothes and rich jewels, but at midnight turns into
a devouring demon with a craving for human flesh.</p>

<p>Just as some of the themes of these stories do not
seem to have European counterparts, so portions of their
machinery appear to be without exact western equivalents.
The stupendous transformations which now and then take
place (see pp. <a href="#Page_5">5</a>, <a href="#Page_148">148</a>, <a href="#Page_244">244</a>) can reconcile themselves only to
an oriental imagination. However much the occidental mind
may attempt to &ldquo;make believe,&rdquo; it cannot credit such a statement
as that when the B&eacute;l-Princess died, her eyes turned into
two birds, her heart into &ldquo;a great tank,&rdquo; and her body into &ldquo;a
splendid palace and garden,&rdquo; her arms and legs becoming
&ldquo;the pillars that supported the verandah roof,&rdquo; and her head
&ldquo;the dome on the top of the palace.&rdquo; In almost all countries,
when a fairy hero has been slain by a demoniacal or otherwise
villainous personage, he is recalled to life by magic means.
In European folk-lore the resuscitating remedy is usually a
Water of Life, or a Balsam, or some similar fluid. In these
Indian tales, it is blood streaming from the resuscitator&rsquo;s
little finger. Thus when Loving Lail&iacute; (p. <a href="#Page_83">83</a>) found her
husband dead and headless, she put his head back on his
shoulders, and smeared his neck with the blood which flowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xiii]</a></span>
&ldquo;like healing medicine,&rdquo; when &ldquo;she cut her little finger
inside her hand straight down from the top of her nail to
her palm.&rdquo; A power of becoming at will invisible is everywhere
often attributed to heroes of romance. But it is
generally connected with &ldquo;a cap of darkness,&rdquo; or some
similar magic article. But the Prince of No. <a href="#Page_138">21</a>, when he
seeks the B&eacute;l-Princess, becomes invisible to the &ldquo;demons
and fairies&rdquo; who surround her, when he blows from the
palm of his hand, &ldquo;all along his fingers,&rdquo; the earth which
a friendly fak&iacute;r has given him for that purpose. A &ldquo;sleep-thorn,&rdquo;
or other somniferous piece of wood, is commonly
employed in our fairy tales, in order to throw a hero or
heroine into a magic slumber. In these Indian stories a
state of catalepsy, or of death, is produced or relieved by a
peculiar application of a magic stick. Thus the Princess
who was called the Golden R&aacute;n&iacute;, &ldquo;because her teeth and
her hair were made of gold,&rdquo; and who was stolen by a
demon, informed the Prince who found her, motionless but
not sleeping, that &ldquo;the Rakshas who had carried her off,
and whom she called papa, had a great thick stick, and
when he laid this stick at her feet she could not stir, but
when he laid it at her head she could move again.&rdquo; In &ldquo;The
Demon and the King&rsquo;s Son&rdquo; (No. <a href="#Page_173">24</a>), the hero opens a
&ldquo;forbidden chamber,&rdquo; and there finds the demon&rsquo;s
daughter lying on a bed, apparently lifeless; for &ldquo;every
day, before her father went out he used to make the girl lie
on her bed, and cover her with a sheet, and he placed a
thick stick at her head, and another at her feet; then
she died, till he came home in the evening and changed
the sticks, putting the one at her head at her feet, and
the one at her feet at her head. This brought her to life
again.&rdquo; An interesting parallel to the &ldquo;sleep-thorn&rdquo; is
afforded by the pin which, while it remains in the head
of the bird which had been the wife of the Pomegranate
King (No. <a href="#Page_7">2</a>), prevents her from resuming her human shape.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xiv]</a></span>
When the R&aacute;j&aacute; pulled out the pin, &ldquo;his own dear wife, the
Pomegranate R&aacute;n&iacute;, stood before him.&rdquo; Magic boxes are
common in fairy land. But there is something new in at least
the name of the &ldquo;sun-jewel box,&rdquo; which was sent by the
&ldquo;Red Fairy,&rdquo; who lived at the bottom of the well, to &ldquo;The
Princess who loved her father like salt&rdquo; (No. <a href="#Page_164">23</a>), and
which contained &ldquo;seven little dolls, who were all little
fairies.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad">Of more general interest than the few peculiarities of
these tales are the many points in which they resemble and
illustrate some of the familiar features of European folk-lore.
As an example of the latter may be taken a &ldquo;husk-myth,&rdquo;
which is a valuable contribution to the literature of
the &ldquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo; cycle. In all the stories belonging
to that group, the action turns upon the union of
the human hero or heroine with a spouse who is really or
apparently an inferior animal. In the modified version of
the story with which our nurseries have become acquainted
through a French literary medium, the species of Beast to
which the Beauty is wedded is not stated, and its transformation
into a princely husband is attributed to her unaided
love. But in by far the greater part of the variants of the
folk-tale on which it seems to have been founded, as well as
of the other stories in which a similar transformation is
the principal feature&mdash;variants which have been gathered in
abundance from all parts of Europe, not to speak of Asia&mdash;the
animal nature of the mysterious spouse is clearly
defined. In them the husband whom the Beauty is induced
by filial affection, fear, or compassion to wed, is an
unmistakable Beast&mdash;a pig in Sicily, a bear in Norway, a
hedgehog in Germany, a goat in Russia. Sometimes he is
even of a lower type, often a frog or a snake. And once, in
Wallachia, he has been transferred from the animal to the
vegetable world, and figures as a pumpkin. In every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xv]</a></span>
instance he is represented as being able to change at times
his repulsive appearance for one of beauty, and this he
generally does by doffing a kind of husk which when donned
conceals his real form, and invests him with that of an
inferior being. If this husk be destroyed during the
temporary absence of its owner, he loses his transforming
power. The destruction of the husk is generally the work
of the wife, who is sometimes rewarded, her husband remaining
with her constant to his true nature; at other times
she is punished, he being lost to her for a time or for ever.
These stories about a monster husband have their exact
counterparts in tales about a monster wife, the leading idea
being the same in both groups; the only difference being
that it is the wife who appears at times as a frog or other
inferior creature, and who continues to do so until her
transforming power terminates with the destruction of her
disguising husk.</p>

<p>Now these temporary transformations, though common
to the folk-tales of all parts of Europe, are not in accordance
with the European superstitions of the present
day, nor with those, so far as we are acquainted with them,
of old European heathenism. The nearest approach to
them is afforded by the wehr-wolf superstition, but that is an
isolated belief, and appears to be based upon altogether different
ideas. As to the metamorphoses of classical literature,
they are of a nature quite alien to that of the voluntary
eclipse, under a degrading form, of a Frog Princess or a Pig
Prince. It may be said with confidence that European
&ldquo;husk-myths&rdquo; do not explain themselves; the peasants
among whom they are current, cannot explain them; and
the knowledge we have of ancient European paganism
throws no light on their meaning. But in India, where
countless variants of such tales exist&mdash;many of them
preserved in ancient as well as in modern literature, but
by far the greater part still current among the common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xvi]</a></span>
people&mdash;the transformations in question are frequently, if
not generally, explained in the stories themselves, and explained
in a manner perfectly in accordance with the Indian
thought of the present as well as of the past. To Indian
minds there is nothing monstrous in the belief that a
celestial being may have been condemned, in consequence
of the wrath of a superior divinity, or even of the magic
words pronounced by an offended sage, to assume for a
time the inferior form of a mere man or woman, or even
to wear the shape of an inferior animal&mdash;a monkey or a
frog; and that this transformation is to continue chronic,
though not constant, until the destruction of the disguising
skin or husk, by the donning of which it is from time to
time brought about, deprives the curse of its power,
and enables earth&rsquo;s celestial visitor to return to heaven.
The whole story is closely connected with Indian religious
beliefs, and may fairly be looked upon, when found
in India, as an expansion of a Hindu myth. Its existence in
other parts of Asia may, at least frequently, be attributed to
the natural spread of Hindu tales among the various tribes
and nations which accepted Buddhism from India.</p>

<p>If all this be true, and the &ldquo;husk-myth&rdquo; stories which
are current all over Europe may justly be supposed to have
drifted westwards from India, then all Indian variants of
these tales naturally become invested with special importance.
The specimen in the present volume, the
&ldquo;Monkey Prince&rdquo; (No. <a href="#Page_41">10</a>), belongs to a remarkably interesting
class&mdash;that in which the story-teller gives an
explanation of the hero&rsquo;s transformation. A childless
king is told by a fak&iacute;r to give some mangoes to his seven
wives. Six of them eat up the fruit, and each of the six
gives birth to a prince of the usual kind. But the seventh
wife, who has been able to obtain as her share only the
stone of one of the mangoes, &ldquo;had a monkey, who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xvii]</a></span>
called in consequence Bandars&aacute;b&aacute;s&aacute;, or Prince Monkey.&rdquo;
In reality, the story-teller goes on to explain, &ldquo;he was a boy,
but no one knew it, for he had a monkey-skin covering him.&rdquo;
And this monkey-skin he takes off when he wishes to appear
in true princely form, as when he woos and wins the Princess
Jah&uacute;ran. Finding out what his real nature is, she insists
upon marrying him, in spite of her vexed father&rsquo;s natural
question: &ldquo;Who ever heard of any one marrying a nasty
monkey?&rdquo; When he is alone with his wife he takes off his
monkey-skin, and reveals himself in all his beauty, replying
to her questions as to its use, &ldquo;I wear it as a protection,
because my brothers are naughty, and would kill
me if they knew what I really am.&rdquo; On one occasion, when
he has gone in state to a nautch, after taking off his monkey
skin, folding it up, and laying it under his wife&rsquo;s pillow,
she reveals her husband&rsquo;s secret to his mother, who,
&ldquo;though she was very glad her monkey-son had such a
wife, could never understand how it was that her daughter-in-law
was so happy with him.&rdquo; Taking the monkey-skin
from under her pillow, &ldquo;See,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;when your son
puts this on, then he is a monkey; when he takes it off he
is a beautiful man. And now I think I will burn this
skin, and then he must always be a man.&rdquo; So she throws it
into the fire. Prince Monkey&rsquo;s heart instantly tells him his
wife has burnt his skin, and he returns home in a rage.
It passes off, however, and all goes well. He now appears
always as a beautiful prince, &ldquo;with his hair all gold.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why
did you wear that monkey-skin?&rdquo; naturally asks his father.
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he replies, &ldquo;my mother ate the mango-stone
instead of eating the mango, and so I was born with this
skin, and God ordered me to wear it till I had found a
wife.&rdquo; The story has evidently been considerably altered in the
course of time from its original form, but it still keeps true
to its ancient lines. In it, as in many other specimens of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xviii]</a></span>
same class, the idea of the degradation of a divine or
semi-divine being has been lost, and the sufferer is merely
a human being cased in a disfiguring hide. It is noteworthy
that, as we are informed at p. <a href="#Page_259">259</a>, Dunkn&iacute;, the
narrator of the tale, &ldquo;in telling this husk-story, just as
often called the monkey-skin a husk, as she called it a
skin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another of the apparently mythological European folk-tales,
instructive parallels to which are contained in the
present volume, is that which may be designated as the
Golden-locks myth. It relates the fortunes of a brilliant
being, usually a radiant prince, who, often without any apparent
reason, submits himself to a voluntary eclipse, hides
from sight his grandeur and his good looks, and assumes
an appearance of squalor and misery. Like Cinderella,
whose male counterpart he is, he at times arises from his
low estate, becomes again a brilliant prince, but always
capriciously eludes those who wish to retain him in that
shape. At last he is always detected, and then he has to
remain constant to his true and magnificent form. His
temporary eclipse is somewhat similar to that of the
hero of a husk-myth; but no special power is attached
to the wrappings under which his brilliance is concealed,
nor is his change of form imposed upon him against
his will. The meaning of the Golden-locks story, in
its original form, still remains to be discovered, as also
does that of the sister tale of Cinderella. That they both
refer to the temporary eclipse, seclusion, or obscuration of
a brilliant being, is evident. But what that brilliant being
represents is a problem of which several solutions have
been confidently offered, but which does not seem to
have been as yet certainly solved. In the story of &ldquo;The
Boy who had a Moon on his forehead and a Star on his
chin&rdquo; (No. <a href="#Page_119">20</a>), the self-eclipsing process is brought about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xix]</a></span>
by a twist of his right ear; &ldquo;when the boy had twisted it,
he was no longer a handsome prince, but a poor, common-looking,
ugly man; and his moon and star were hidden.&rdquo;
And so, after he has been chosen out of a number of
suitors by a princess whose heart he has won by the beauty
of his singing, he restores himself to his true form by twisting
his left ear; after which operation &ldquo;he stood no longer
a poor, common, ugly man, but a grand young prince, with
a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A third class of stories for which an Asiatic origin may
fairly be claimed, contains those in which figures a monster
or demon who cannot be killed until some external object
with which his life is mysteriously linked has been destroyed.
Such a being occurs at times in European folk-tales, especially
in those of the east and north of Europe. The
most familiar instance is that of &ldquo;The Giant who had no
Heart in his body&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Tales from the Norse.&rdquo; Some
of the best specimens of this kind of monster are to be found
in the Russian tales about Koshchei the Deathless. But
these remarkably abnormal beings scarcely seem at home
in western folk-lore. They are but little in keeping with
their European surroundings, and never seem to divest
themselves of their alien air. In oriental stories, on the
other hand, they figure frequently, and they seem to occupy a
familiar and an appropriate place. The oldest of the world&rsquo;s
tales of wonder, the Egyptian story of the Two Brothers,
contains an heroic being whose life comes to an end when
his heart falls to the ground from the tree upon which he
has hung it. And in the modern folk-tales of India, demons
of this kind play their part without exciting any more than
usual surprise. Miss Frere&rsquo;s Deccan stories make us
well acquainted with one of these personages, &ldquo;a wicked
magician named Punchkin,&rdquo; whose name serves as a convenient
designation for the long-lived monsters in question.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xx]</a></span>
The present collection contains several specimens. In
&ldquo;Brave H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;lb&aacute;s&aacute;&rdquo; (No. <a href="#Page_51">11</a>) we meet with a Rakshas,
who is induced, as usual by female wiles, to reveal the
secret of his life. &ldquo;Sixteen miles away from this place,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;is a tree. Round the tree are tigers, and bears, and
scorpions, and snakes; on the top of the tree is a very
great flat snake; on his head is a little cage; in the cage is
a bird; and my soul is in that bird.&rdquo; When the bird is
seized by the hero of the story, the Rakshas feels that something
terrible has occurred. When the bird&rsquo;s legs and wings
are pulled off, the Rakshas becomes a mere head and torso;
and when the bird&rsquo;s neck is wrung, down falls the Rakshas
dead. In like manner, in the tale of &ldquo;The Demon and the
King&rsquo;s Son&rdquo; (No. <a href="#Page_173">24</a>), the demon dies when the prince has
killed a certain bird, the lives of the bird and of the demon
being conterminable. According to the narrator Dunkn&iacute;, &ldquo;all
Rakshases keep their souls in birds;&rdquo; but another authority
asserts (p. <a href="#Page_261">261</a>) that &ldquo;a whole tribe of Rakshases, dwelling
in Ceylon, kept theirs in one and the same lemon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tale of &ldquo;The Voracious Frog&rdquo; (No. <a href="#Page_24">6</a>) is a valuable
contribution to the store we already possess of what appear to
be myths relating to apparent destruction, but ultimate
resuscitation. To this class seem to belong the stories on
which Little Red Riding Hood was probably based,
describing how a wolf or other monster swallowed various
innocent beings, but was at last forced to restore them
uninjured to the light of day. In its original form the tale
may have been a nature myth, illustrating the apparent
annihilation brought about by the darkness of night or the
cold of winter, and the revival which accompanies the return
of the day or of spring; or, perhaps, a moral apologue,
intended to suggest that death may not be a lasting annihilation.
In its modern forms, whether in the east or the
west, it often assumes a grotesque air. A good illustration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xxi]</a></span>
of this fact is afforded by the well-known Norse tale of
&ldquo;The Greedy Cat,&rdquo; of which &ldquo;The Voracious Frog&rdquo; (No. <a href="#Page_24">6</a>)
is an Indian counterpart. The cat, after devouring all that
comes in its way, is at last split in half by a goat, whereupon
all its victims come forth unhurt. The frog, after similar
feats of gluttony, is cut open by a barber, who, while shaving
it, thinks that it looks very fat; and its victims also emerge
uninjured.</p>

<p>There are many tales now current in different parts of
Europe, but chiefly in the south and east, which turn upon
the relations existing between human beings and their fates:
each person being supposed to have a special fate or fortune,
a species of guardian demon, upon whose good will all his
or her success in life depends. It is very doubtful whether
such stories are products of European fancy, their leading
ideas seeming to be little in keeping with the religious
beliefs&mdash;whether of classic times, or of Teutonic, Slavic, or
Celtic antiquity&mdash;respecting either an overruling destiny, or
a triad of Fates or Norns. But in India a belief in a
personal &ldquo;luck&rdquo; has prevailed from very early times; and
such stories as &ldquo;The Man who went to seek his Fate&rdquo;
(No. <a href="#Page_63">12</a>), appear there to be as indigenous as in Europe
they seem to be exotic. The Servian story, for instance, of
the man who sets out to look for his fate, and the Sicilian
account of how the unfortunate Caterina is persecuted by hers
until she discovers its hiding-place, and propitiates it by cakes
(see Notes, p. <a href="#Page_263">263</a>), have a foreign air about them, which
does not manifest itself in the Indian tale. The likeness
between the Servian and the Indian variants of the narrative,
especially as regards the questions which the fate-seeker is
requested by the beings he meets on the way to ask when
he arrives at his destination, is too great to allow it to be
supposed that they have been independently developed
from a common germ. They are manifestly, so far as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xxii]</a></span>
journey is concerned, copies of the same model, differing
but slightly from each other. But the embodiment of the
wayfarer&rsquo;s destiny is quite differently represented in the two
stories. The Servian pilgrim first discovers his fortune, or
rather misfortune, in the person of a hag, who tells him she
has been given to him as his luck by Fate. Then he seeks
out Fate, who appears in human form. But in the Indian
tale, &ldquo;the fates are stones, some standing, and others lying
on the ground.&rdquo; One of the prostrate stones, the traveller
felt sure, must belong to him. &ldquo;This must be mine,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;it is lying on the ground, that&rsquo;s why I am so poor.&rdquo;
Whereupon he took to beating it, and continued to do so
all day. When night came, &ldquo;God sent a soul into the poor
man&rsquo;s fate, and it became a man,&rdquo; who satisfied the wanderer&rsquo;s
own wishes, and also answered the questions which he
had been requested to ask. Then &ldquo;God withdrew the soul,
and the fate became a stone again, which stood up on the
ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are two stories which enjoy a world-wide popularity
in peasant circles, but which have not been made familiar
by modern literature to cultured children. One of them
may for the sake of convenience be known by the name of
the Substituted Bride, and the other by that of the Calumniated
Wife. The first relates the sorrows of a maiden who
is compelled to see an impostor seated in the place which
she was intended to fill, by the side of the princely husband
whom she was meant to wed. The second describes the
sufferings long undergone by a faithful wife and tender
mother, who is falsely accused of some crime by an envious
rival, and is hastily punished by her angry lord. In both
of them the supernatural usually plays a part, but their main
interests are always human, and it is easier to sympathize
with their heroines than with most of the similar characters of
popular fiction. Yet those ill-used but patient princesses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xxiii]</a></span>
are but little known to the thousands of story-readers who
are familiar with the adventures of Cinderella and the
Sleeping Beauty, Little Red Riding Hood, and the wives of
Bluebeard and of the Beast. They have at various times
entered into literature, but not into that section of it which
has supplied our nursery fiction. They figure in most of the
now so numerous collections of folk-tales, but they have not
been introduced into society by the novelists or playwrights
who have made their sister-sufferers undying favourites.
They are essentially moral tales, their good characters bearing
their unmerited misfortunes with unvarying meekness
and patience, and being ultimately rewarded, while the
envious and malicious rivals who have supplanted or slandered
them are punished in the end. But they have not
taken a firm hold on the west, where they are probably
destined to become forgotten when the progress of education
has replaced folk-lore by literature, while they are likely to
go on living for ages in the east, which seems to have been
their original home.</p>

<p>In the present collection the story of the Substituted
Princess occurs several times. In &ldquo;Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute;&rdquo; the
heroine is a wife instead of a bride, which makes the substitution
more than usually improbable. As she and her husband
are resting beside a tank, a shoemaker&rsquo;s wife comes
up, and pushes her into the water, in which she is drowned.
The shoemaker&rsquo;s wife takes her place, though she is &ldquo;very
black and ugly,&rdquo; one-eyed, and exceedingly wicked. It may
be remarked that the substitution in question generally
takes place by the side of water. In the &ldquo;B&eacute;l-Princess,&rdquo; the
beautiful maiden who has come out of the fruit which the
prince opened by the side of a well, is pushed into the
water, while the prince is asleep, by a wicked woman, very
ugly, and with &ldquo;something wrong with one of her eyes,&rdquo;
who then assumes her place. In tales like the story of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xxiv]</a></span>
&ldquo;The Princess who loved her Father like Salt,&rdquo; the transformation
scene is of a different nature, though the leading
idea of the change is the same. It is not an ordinary bride
or wife who is supplanted, and the substitution need not take
place beside water. The heroine is a stranger who, generally
after long wanderings, finds a prince really or apparently
dead, by patient watching all but effects his cure, but is at
the last moment supplanted by a servant, who gives the
final touch to the work, claims its entire merit, and is made
the wife of the grateful patient. In the Indian tale the
prince lies motionless, his body &ldquo;stuck full of needles.&rdquo;
The heroine sits down by the side of his couch, and there
remains for a whole week &ldquo;without eating, or drinking, or
sleeping, pulling out the needles.&rdquo; At the end of two weeks
more the needles are all extracted, except those in the eyes.
She then goes away to bathe; and while she is absent,
a servant maid whom she has left in charge of the body pulls
out the remaining needles. The prince opens his eyes,
thanks God for bringing him to life again, and makes the
servant maid his wife. The substitution is similar to that
which takes place in such stories as the Norse &ldquo;Bushy
Bride;&rdquo; but closer parallels are supplied by some of the
stories of southern Europe. Mrs. Stokes refers in her Notes
to the dead prince in one of Gonzenbach&rsquo;s Sicilian tales,
who is brought to life by a wandering princess, who for
more than seven years rubs his body with grass from Mount
Calvary. Pitre&rsquo;s great collection of Sicilian <i>Fiabe</i> also offers
several variants of the substitution story, in some of which
occurs the singular incident, known also to Swedish and
Finnish folk-tales, of the imprisonment of the heroine, after
she has been flung into the sea, by a submarine supernatural
being. In some instances it is not water which the heroine
has to dread, but light. The true bride must be conveyed
to the bridegroom&rsquo;s palace in a darkened vehicle. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xxv]</a></span>
supplanter draws aside a curtain. The sunlight shines in.
The princess turns into a lizard or some other animal, and
the false bride takes her place.</p>

<p>The Calumniated Wife story which occurs in No. <a href="#Page_119">20</a> of
the present collection, closely resembles many European
variants. A king hears a girl say that when she is married
she will have a son with a moon on his forehead and a star
on his chin. So he marries her. She gives birth to a boy
who really is thus decorated. But the king&rsquo;s other wives,
naturally jealous of her, put a stone in her bed, and pretend
that it is the object which she has brought into the world,
upon which she is disgraced and turned into a servant maid.
In other variants of the story she is often accused of having
murdered her children, and even eaten them. In one
instance her mortified husband is represented as twice forgiving
her, after remonstrating with her on her inordinate
appetite, but as thinking it necessary to take some precautions
when the possibility of her committing the crime
for the third time makes itself manifest. Sometimes all
the innocent wives of a king are accused of murderous
habits by a guilty wife, who is in reality a destroying and
devouring demon. Such is the case in No. <a href="#Page_119">20</a> of the
present collection, which ends with the restoration of the
seven calumniated wives, and the death by burning of the
demon spouse.</p>


<p class="hrpad">Besides illustrating the themes or leading ideas of many
groups of European tales, these Indian stories frequently
serve to throw light upon some of their obscurer features, or
at least to offer such parallels to them as are useful contributions
to our stock of materials for a systematic classification.
Among the strange characters who figure in European
folk tales, there are few more puzzling than the fair maidens
who are at times discovered inside fruits, and who must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xxvi]</a></span>
provided with water to drink the moment they emerge into
the light, or else they will die. They seem properly to
belong to the south and east of Europe, to such countries,
for instance, as Greece, Sicily, and Wallachia. When they
are found elsewhere, as in the Norse tale of &ldquo;The Three
Lemons,&rdquo; the very name of which speaks of the sunny south,
they seem out of keeping with their surroundings. In these
Indian stories, the enclosure of a heroine in a fruit is an incident
which does not appear to be more than usually amazing.
The need of immediate water drinking is not referred to.
But the hero is warned (p. <a href="#Page_81">81</a>) that he must not open the fruit
in public, because the enclosed maiden will be quite
destitute of clothes. In another story which is widely spread
over Europe&mdash;but which we know best in the form of the
tale of &ldquo;The Blue Bird,&rdquo; founded upon the theme of &ldquo;The
Lay of Ywonec,&rdquo; by Marie de France&mdash;the murderous
means by which the bird-lover is all but done to death
by jealous hands, which set sharp knives in the narrow
opening through which he has to fly, or beset his path with
some other instruments of ill, find their counterpart in the
powdered glass employed to injure the hero of the &ldquo;The
Fan Prince&rdquo; (No. <a href="#Page_193">25</a>). His wife&rsquo;s six sisters, who &ldquo;were
angry at their youngest sister being married, while they who
were older were not married,&rdquo; insist upon making his
bed, and cover the spot on which he is to lie with the
powder into which they have ground a glass bottle. Whereupon
the prince becomes very ill, from the glass powder
going into his flesh.</p>

<p>The ordinary opening of many familiar folk-tales, including
the &ldquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo; story, finds a parallel
in the same Indian tale (p. <a href="#Page_195">195</a>). In all of them a
man, when starting on a journey, promises his youngest
daughter that he will bring her back some object. This he
forgets to obtain. On his homeward journey, his ship refuses
to move until he has acquired the object in question.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xxvii]</a></span>
The Indian parent promised to bring home Sabr to his
daughter, having no idea what Sabr meant. Not having
obtained it, he set out on his homeward journey. &ldquo;But the
boat would not move, because he had forgotten one thing&mdash;the
thing his youngest daughter had asked for.&rdquo; Sabr
turns out to be a fairy prince. It is a common incident in
Indian tales for a hero or heroine to demand a spouse,
generally of a more or less supernatural nature, whose
name is known but nothing more. Just as the Fan
Prince was demanded, under the apparently meaningless
name of Sabr, so is the hand of the Princess Lab&aacute;m longed
for by the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son in No. <a href="#Page_153">22</a>, although her existence
was unknown to him till he heard a parrot pronounce her
name one day; and so is the acquisition of a B&eacute;l-Princess
resolved upon by the prince in No. <a href="#Page_138">21</a>, because his sisters-in-law
say to him, in a disagreeable manner, &ldquo;We think
that you will marry a B&eacute;l-Princess.&rdquo; M&uacute;niy&aacute;, the narrator
of the story, &ldquo;says that telling the prince he would marry
a B&eacute;l-Princess was equivalent to saying he would not
marry at all; for these brothers&rsquo; wives knew she lived in
the fairy country, and that it would be very difficult, if not
impossible, for the prince to find her, and take her from
it.&rdquo; But this seems to be merely a rationalistic view of the
matter. Some mystery seems to underlie these suggestions of,
or desires for, unions with unfamiliar beings. They occur not
unfrequently in Russian tales. In one of Afanasief&rsquo;s skazkas
(vol. vii., No. 6) a baby prince cries, and refuses to go to
sleep, till his royal father rocks his cradle, crooning the
while, &ldquo;Sleep, beloved one! When you grow up you shall
marry Never-enough-to-be-gazed-at Beauty, daughter of
three mothers, sister of nine brothers.&rdquo; Having slept
vigorously, the baby awakes, asks for the king&rsquo;s blessing,
and sets out in search of the unknown Beauty in question.
In another (vol. i., No. 14), Prince Ivan, having married his
three sisters to the Wind, the Hail, and the Thunder,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xxviii]</a></span>
wanders forth in search of a bride. Finding the remains of
two slaughtered armies, and discovering that their slaughterer
was named Anastasia the Fair, he resolves, though
knowing nothing else about her, to make her his wife.
Among the numerous minor incidents which are common
to eastern and western folk-tales, may be mentioned the
aid lent to heroes in difficulties by Magic Instruments, as
in No. <a href="#Page_153">22</a>, or by Grateful Beasts, as in No. <a href="#Page_173">24</a>. A belief in
magic is of course world-wide, but the particular instruments
referred to seem to have good reasons for claiming an
oriental extraction. The stories in which stress is laid
upon the gratitude of the inferior animals are almost always
derivable from the east; especially if, as in the correct
versions of the tale on which Puss in Boots is founded, their
gratitude is contrasted with the ingratitude of that superior
animal, man. When we meet with so close a resemblance
as exists between the miracle wrought by Shekh Far&iacute;d
(p. <a href="#Page_97">97</a>), who turns the lying carter&rsquo;s sugar into ashes, and that
attributed to St. Brigit, who turns the liar&rsquo;s salt into stones,
we need have little scruple about referring both stories to
the same source and, considering how much monastic
legend-writers were indebted to oriental fancy, in locating
that source in the east.</p>

<p>The comic elements of eastern and western folk-lore are
closely akin, and the Lie-stories, or <i>L&uuml;genm&auml;rchen</i>, in Nos.
<a href="#Page_18">4</a>, <a href="#Page_35">8</a>, and <a href="#Page_101">17</a> of these Indian Tales find their parallels in most
European collections. As an example of the close kinship
which prevails among the jests which make merry the hearts
of men far apart from each other, we may take the Indian
story of &ldquo;Foolish Sach&uacute;l&iacute;,&rdquo; and compare it with the Russian
tale of &ldquo;The Fool and the Birch Tree&rdquo; (Afanasief, vol. v.,
No. 22). Sach&uacute;l&iacute; kills a woman; his Russian counterpart kills
a man. The corpse of the woman is hidden away in a well,
that of the man in a cellar. In each case the fool&rsquo;s sensible
relatives, knowing that he will be sure to tell the truth if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xxix]</a></span>
he is asked, withdraw the body during his absence, and
substitute for it that of an animal killed for the purpose.
When the seekers after the victim arrive at Sach&uacute;l&iacute;&rsquo;s home,
he at once conducts them to the well. Being let down into
it, he asks, &ldquo;Has she got eyes?&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course, every one
has eyes,&rdquo; is the reply. &ldquo;Has she a nose?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, she
has a nose.&rdquo; But at last he inquires if she has four feet;
and the seekers after the dead woman find that the body
in the well is that of a sheep. In the same way, when the
Russian fool has confessed his guilt, and has gone into the
cellar to look for his victim&rsquo;s remains, he finds there the
body of a goat. So he calls out to the anxious inquirers,
&ldquo;Was your man dark-haired?&rdquo; &ldquo;He was.&rdquo; &ldquo;And had
he a beard?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, he had a beard.&rdquo; &ldquo;And had he
horns?&rdquo; &ldquo;What horns are you talking about, fool?&rdquo; they
reply. So he hands up the goat&rsquo;s head, and the Russian
tale comes to the same conclusion as the Indian. The likeness
here is too strong to be attributed to an accidental
coincidence.</p>


<p class="hrpad">It does not, of course, follow that, because a story is
found both in Europe and Asia, therefore the western
version has been borrowed from the east. Europe has,
doubtless, sometimes lent a fancy to Asia. Greek fables
are supposed to have exercised an influence upon the Indian
mind. European missionaries may have sometimes
rendered a Christian legend current among Hindus. Professor
Monier Williams was assured by an intelligent native
that the spread of railways had materially diminished the
number of malignant ghosts in India. Still, as a general
rule, the east is stubbornly conservative. The Japanese, it is
true, are abandoning their own costume and art for ours, not
entirely to their advantage. But the various peoples of
India have never shown any such tendencies towards
change. In their popular fiction, at all events, they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xxx]</a></span>
never shown an inclination to import foreign manufactures
in order to replace their home products. In their thoughts
and feelings they are now very much what they have been for
periods of time which it would be difficult to define. When
we find stories now current in all parts of India, which we
know from their occurrence in Sanskrit literature must have
existed there very long ago, and we see that the mythological
element in those stories is in accordance with religious
ideas that have prevailed there for countless centuries,
we can have no doubt that these stories were framed there
at a very early period. Then if we find almost identical
stories current in all parts of Europe, many of their at least
apparently mythological features offering difficulties which
cannot be removed by a reference to the mythologies of the
heathen ancestors of the peasants who now repeat them, it
seems not unreasonable to come to the conclusion that
such stories have been borrowed by the west from the east.
From mythological germs common to European and Asiatic
Aryans, it is quite true that legends might arise in Europe
and in Asia, independent of each other, but similar in
their general tenor. But it is not likely that out of any
common germ could be independently developed in several
different countries as many variants of the same tale, in
each of which there is a similar sequence of scenes or acts,
and the dramatic action is brought to a close by a termination
that scarcely ever varies. Far more difficult is it to believe
in such a triumph of independent development, than to place
reliance upon a statement to the effect that the wave of
story-telling, as well as of empire, has wended its way westward.</p>

PH&Uacute;LMATI R&Aacute;N&Iacute;.</h2>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#ni">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapt"><span class="dcap">T</span></span>HERE were once a R&aacute;j&aacute; and a R&aacute;n&iacute; who had an
only daughter called the Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute;, or the
Pink-rose Queen. She was so beautiful that if
she went into a very dark room it was all lighted up by her
beauty. On her head was the sun; on her hands, moons;
and her face was covered with stars. She had hair that
reached to the ground, and it was made of pure gold.</p>

<p>Every day after she had had her bath, her father and
mother used to weigh her in a pair of scales. She only
weighed one flower. She ate very, very little food. This
made her father most unhappy, and he said, &ldquo;I cannot let
my daughter marry any one who weighs more than one
flower.&rdquo; Now, God loved this girl dearly, so he went down
under the ground to see if any of the fairy R&aacute;j&aacute;s was fit to
be the Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s husband, and he thought none of
them good enough. So he went in the form of a Fak&iacute;r to
see the great Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute; who ruled over all the other
fairy R&aacute;j&aacute;s. This R&aacute;j&aacute; was exceedingly beautiful. On his
head was the sun; and on his hands, moons; and on his
face, stars. God made him weigh very little. Then he said
to the R&aacute;j&aacute;, &ldquo;Come up with me, and we will go to the palace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
of the Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute;.&rdquo; God had told the R&aacute;j&aacute; that he
was God and not a Fak&iacute;r, for he loved the Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute;.
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute;. So they travelled on
until they came to the Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s palace. When they
arrived there they pitched a tent in her compound, and they
used to walk about, and whenever they saw the Ph&uacute;lmati
R&aacute;n&iacute; they looked at her. One day they saw her having
her hair combed, so God said to the Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute;, &ldquo;Get a
horse and ride where the Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute; can see you, and
if any one asks you who you are, say, &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only a poor
Fak&iacute;r, and I am his son. We have come to stay here a
little while just to see the country. We will go away very
soon.&rsquo;&rdquo; Well, he got a horse and rode about, and Ph&uacute;lmati
R&aacute;n&iacute;, who was having her hair combed in the verandah,
said, &ldquo;I am sure that must be some R&aacute;j&aacute;; only see how
beautiful he is.&rdquo; And she sent one of her servants to ask
him who he was. So the servant said to the Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute;,
&ldquo;Who are you? why are you here? what do you want?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only a poor Fak&iacute;r, and I am his son. We have
just come here for a little while to see the country. We will
go away very soon.&rdquo; So the servants returned to the Ph&uacute;lmati
R&aacute;n&iacute; and told her what the Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute; had said.
The Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute; told her father about this. The next
day, when the Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute; and her father were standing
in the verandah, God took a pair of scales and weighed the
Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute; in them. His weight was only that of one
flower! &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute;, when he saw that, &ldquo;here is
the husband for the Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute;!&rdquo; The next day, after
the Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute; had had her bath, her father took her
and weighed her, and he also weighed the Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute;.
And they were each the same weight. Each weighed one
flower, although the Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute; was fat and the Ph&uacute;lmati
R&aacute;n&iacute; thin. The next day they were married, and there
was a grand wedding. God said he was too poor-looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
to appear, so he bought a quantity of elephants, and camels,
and horses, and cows, and sheep, and goats, and made a
procession, and came to the wedding. Then he went back
to heaven, but before he went he said to the Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute;
&ldquo;You must stay here one whole year; then go back to your
father and to your kingdom. As long as you put flowers
on your ears no danger will come near you.&rdquo; (This was in
order that the fairies might know that he was a very great
R&aacute;j&aacute; and not hurt him.) &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Indr&aacute;san
R&aacute;j&aacute;. And God went back to heaven.</p>

<p>So the Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute; stayed for a whole year. Then he
told the R&aacute;j&aacute;, the Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s father, that he wished to
go back to his own kingdom. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute;,
and he wanted to give him horses, and camels, and elephants.
But the Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute; and the Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute; said they
wanted nothing but a tent and a cooly. Well, they set out;
but the Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute; forgot to put flowers on his ears, and
after some days the Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute; was very, very tired, so
he said, &ldquo;We will sit down under these big trees and rest
awhile. Our baggage will soon be here; it is only a little
way behind.&rdquo; So they sat down, and the R&aacute;j&aacute; said he felt
so tired he must sleep. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;n&iacute;; &ldquo;lay
your head in my lap and sleep.&rdquo; After a while a shoemaker&rsquo;s
wife came by to get some water from a tank which was close
to the spot where the R&aacute;j&aacute; and R&aacute;n&iacute; were resting. Now, the
shoemaker&rsquo;s wife was very black and ugly, and she had only
one eye, and she was exceedingly wicked. The R&aacute;n&iacute; was
very thirsty and she said to the woman, &ldquo;Please give me
some water, I am so thirsty.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you want any,&rdquo; said the
shoemaker&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;come to the tank and get it yourself.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But I cannot,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;n&iacute;, &ldquo;for the R&aacute;j&aacute; is sleeping
in my lap.&rdquo; At last the poor R&aacute;n&iacute; got so very, very thirsty,
she said she must have some water; so laying the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s
head very gently on the ground she went to the tank. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
the wicked shoemaker&rsquo;s wife, instead of giving her to drink,
gave her a push and sent the beautiful R&aacute;n&iacute; into the water,
where she was drowned. The shoemaker&rsquo;s wife then went
back to the R&aacute;j&aacute;, and, taking his head on her knee, sat still
until he woke. When the R&aacute;j&aacute; woke he was much frightened,
and he said, &ldquo;This is not my wife. My wife was not
black, and she had two eyes.&rdquo; The poor R&aacute;j&aacute; felt very
unhappy. He said, &ldquo;I am sure something has happened to
my wife.&rdquo; He went to the tank, and he saw flowers floating
on the water and he caught them, and as he caught them his
own true wife stood before him.</p>

<p>They travelled on till they came to a little house. The
shoemaker&rsquo;s wife went with them. They went into the house
and laid themselves down to sleep, and the R&aacute;j&aacute; laid beside
him the flowers he had found floating in the tank. The
R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s life was in the flowers. As soon as the R&aacute;j&aacute; and R&aacute;n&iacute;
were asleep, the shoemaker&rsquo;s wife took the flowers, broke
them into little bits, and burnt them. The R&aacute;n&iacute; died immediately,
for the second time. Then the poor R&aacute;j&aacute;, feeling
very lonely and unhappy, travelled on to his kingdom,
and the shoemaker&rsquo;s wife went after him. God brought the
Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute; to life a second time, and led her to the
Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s gardener.</p>

<p>One day as the Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute; was going out hunting, he
passed by the gardener&rsquo;s house, and saw a beautiful girl sitting
in it. He thought she looked very like his wife, the Ph&uacute;lmati
R&aacute;n&iacute;. So he went home to his father and said,
&ldquo;Father, I should like to be married to the girl who lives in
our gardener&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the father; &ldquo;you can
be married at once.&rdquo; So they were married the next day.</p>

<p>One night the shoemaker&rsquo;s wife took a ram, killed it, and
put some of its blood on the Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s mouth while
the R&aacute;n&iacute; slept. The next morning she went to the Indr&aacute;san
R&aacute;j&aacute; and said, &ldquo;Whom have you married? You have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
married a Rakshas. Just see. She has been eating cows, and
sheep, and chickens. Just come and see.&rdquo; The R&aacute;j&aacute; went,
and when he saw the blood on his wife&rsquo;s mouth he was
frightened, and he thought she was really a Rakshas. The
shoemaker&rsquo;s wife said to him, &ldquo;If you do not cut this
woman in pieces, some harm will happen to you.&rdquo; So the
R&aacute;j&aacute; took a knife and cut his beautiful wife into pieces.
He then went away very sorrowful. The Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s
arms and legs grew into four houses; her chest became a
tank, and her head a house in the middle of the tank; her
eyes turned into two little doves; and these five houses, the
tank and the doves, were transported to the jungle. No one
knew this. The little doves lived in the house that stood in
the middle of the tank. The other four houses stood round
the tank.</p>

<p>One day when the Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute; was hunting by himself
in the jungle he was very tired, and he saw the house in the
tank. So he said, &ldquo;I will go into that house to rest a little
while, and to-morrow I will return home to my father.&rdquo; So,
tying his horse outside, he went into the house and lay down
to sleep. By and by, the two little birds came and perched
on the roof above his head. They began to talk, and the
R&aacute;j&aacute; listened. The little husband-dove said to his wife,
&ldquo;This is the man who cut his wife to pieces.&rdquo; And then he
told her how the Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute; had married the beautiful
Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute;, who weighed only one flower, and how the
shoemaker&rsquo;s wife had drowned her; how God had brought
her to life again; how the shoemaker&rsquo;s wife had burned her;
and last of all, how the R&aacute;j&aacute; himself had cut her to pieces.
&ldquo;And cannot the R&aacute;j&aacute; find her again?&rdquo; said the little wife-dove.
&ldquo;Oh, yes, he can,&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;but he does
not know how to do so.&rdquo; &ldquo;But do tell me how he can find
her,&rdquo; said the little wife-dove. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said her husband,
&ldquo;every night, at twelve o&rsquo;clock, the R&aacute;n&iacute; and her servants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
come to bathe in the tank. Her servants wear yellow
dresses, but she wears a red one. Now, if the R&aacute;j&aacute; could
get all their dresses, every one, when they lay them down
and go into the tank to bathe, and throw away all the
yellow dresses one by one, keeping only the red one, he
would recover his wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The R&aacute;j&aacute; heard all these things, and at midnight the R&aacute;n&iacute;
and her servants came to bathe. The R&aacute;j&aacute; lay very quiet,
and after they all had taken off their dresses and gone into
the tank, he jumped up and seized every one of the dresses,&mdash;he
did not leave one of them,&mdash;and ran away as hard as he
could. Then each of the servants, who were only fairies,
screamed out, &ldquo;Give me my dress! What are you doing?
why do you take it away?&rdquo; Then the R&aacute;j&aacute; dropped one by
one the yellow dresses and kept the red one. The fairy
servants picked up the dresses, and forsook the Ph&uacute;lmati
R&aacute;n&iacute; and ran away. The R&aacute;j&aacute; came back to her with her
dress in his hand, and she said, &ldquo;Oh, give me back my
dress. If you keep it I shall die. Three times has God
brought me to life, but he will bring me to life no more.&rdquo;
The R&aacute;j&aacute; fell at her feet and begged her pardon, and they
were reconciled. And he gave her back her dress. Then
they went home, and Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute; had the shoemaker&rsquo;s
wife cut to pieces, and buried in the jungle. And they lived
happily ever after.</p>

THE POMEGRANATE KING.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nii">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapt"><span class="dcap">T</span></span>HERE was once a Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;, called the An&aacute;rb&aacute;s&aacute;,
or Pomegranate King; and a Mah&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute; called the
Gul&iacute;an&aacute;r, or Pomegranate-flower. The Mah&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute;
died leaving two children: a little girl of four or five years
old, and a little boy of three. The Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; was very
sorry when she died, for he loved her dearly. He was
exceedingly fond of his two children, and got for them two
servants: a man to cook their dinner, and an ayah to take
care of them. He also had them taught to read and write.
Soon after his wife&rsquo;s death the neighbouring R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s
daughter&rsquo;s husband died, and she said if any other R&aacute;j&aacute;
would marry her, she would be quite willing to marry him,
and she also said she would like very much to marry the
Pomegranate R&aacute;j&aacute;. So her father went to see the Pomegranate
R&aacute;j&aacute;, and told him that his daughter wished to
marry him. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Pomegranate R&aacute;j&aacute;, &ldquo;I do not
want to marry again, for if I do, the woman I marry will be
sure to be unkind to my two children. She will not take
care of them. She will not pet them and comfort them
when they are unhappy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the other R&aacute;j&aacute;,
&ldquo;my daughter will be very good to them, I assure you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;, &ldquo;I will marry her.&rdquo; So
they were married.</p>

<p>For two or three months everything went on well, but
then the new R&aacute;n&iacute;, who was called the Sunk&aacute;s&iacute; Mah&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute;,
began to beat the poor children, and to scold their servants.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
One day she gave the boy such a hard blow on his cheek
that it swelled. When the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; came out of his office
to get his tiffin, he saw the boy&rsquo;s swollen face, and, calling
the two servants, he said, &ldquo;Who did this? how did my
boy get hurt?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;The R&aacute;n&iacute; gave him such a
hard blow on his cheek that it swelled, and she gets very
angry with us if we say anything about her ill-treatment of
the children, or how she scolds us.&rdquo; The Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; was
exceedingly angry with his wife for this, and said to her,
&ldquo;I never beat my children. Why should you beat them?
If you beat them I will send you away.&rdquo; And he went off
to his office in a great rage. The R&aacute;n&iacute; was very angry.
So she told the little girl to go with the ayah to the bazar.
The ayah and the little girl set off, never suspecting any
evil. As soon as they had gone, the R&aacute;n&iacute; took the little
boy and told him she would kill him. The boy went down
on his knees and begged her to spare his life. But she
said, &ldquo;No; your father is always quarrelling with me, beating
me, and scolding me, all through your fault.&rdquo; The
boy begged and prayed again, saying he would never be
naughty any more. The R&aacute;n&iacute; shook her head, and taking
a large knife she cut off his head. She then cut him up
and made him into a curry. She then buried his head,
and his nails, and his feet in the ground, and she covered
them well with earth, and stamped the ground well down so
that no one should notice it had been disturbed. When
the Pomegranate R&aacute;j&aacute; came home to his dinner, she put
the curry and some rice on the table before him; but the
R&aacute;j&aacute;, seeing his boy was not there, would not eat. He
went and looked everywhere for his son, crying very much,
and the little girl cried very much too, for she loved her
brother dearly. After they had hunted for him for some
time, the little boy appeared. His father embraced him.
&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I cannot eat my
dinner without you.&rdquo; The little boy said, &ldquo;Oh, I was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
the jungle playing with other boys.&rdquo; They then sat down
to dinner, and the curry changed into a kid curry. The
R&aacute;n&iacute; was greatly astonished when she saw the boy. She
said to herself, &ldquo;I cut his head off; I cut him into little
pieces, and I made him into a curry, and yet he is alive!&rdquo;
She then went into the garden to see if his head, and nails,
and feet were in the hole where she had buried them.
But they were not there; it was quite empty. She then
called a sepoy, and said to him, &ldquo;If you will take two children
into the jungle and kill them, I will give you as much
money as you like.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the sepoy. She
then brought the children, and told him to take them to
the jungle. So he took them away to the jungle, but he
had not the heart to kill them, for they were exceedingly
beautiful, and he left them in the jungle near their dead
mother&rsquo;s grave. Then he returned to the R&aacute;n&iacute;, saying he
had done as she wished, and she gave him as much money
as he wanted.</p>

<p>The poor Pomegranate R&aacute;j&aacute; was very unhappy when he
saw his children were not in the palace, and that they could
not be found. He asked his R&aacute;n&iacute; where they were, but
she said she did not know; they had gone out to play and
had never returned. From the day he lost his children the
Pomegranate R&aacute;j&aacute; became melancholy. He did not love
the R&aacute;n&iacute; any more; he hated her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the children lived in a little house built close
to their mother&rsquo;s grave. God had given her life again that
she might take care of them. But they did not know she
was their mother; they thought she was another woman
sent to take care of them. God sent also a man to teach
them. Somehow or other the R&aacute;n&iacute; Sunk&aacute;s&iacute; heard they
were still alive in the jungle. She did not know how she
could kill them. So at last she pretended she was very ill,
and she said to the R&aacute;j&aacute;, &ldquo;The doctor says that in the
jungle there are two children, and he says if you will have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
them killed, and will bring their livers for me to stand on
when I bathe, then I shall get well.&rdquo; The R&aacute;j&aacute; sent a
second sepoy to kill the children, and this man killed them
and brought their livers to the R&aacute;n&iacute;. She stood on them
while bathing, and then said she was quite well. She then
threw the livers into the garden, and during the night a
tree grew up there with two large beautiful flowers on it.
Next morning the R&aacute;n&iacute; looked out and said, &ldquo;I will gather
those flowers to-day.&rdquo; Every day she said she would
gather them, and every day she forgot. At last one day
she said, &ldquo;Every day I forget to gather those flowers, but
to-day I really will do so,&rdquo; and she sent her servant to
pluck them. So he went out, and, just as he was going to
gather them, the flowers flew up just out of his reach.
Then the R&aacute;n&iacute; went down, and when she was going to pick
them they flew up so high that they could not be seen.
Every day she tried to gather them, and every day they
went high up, and came back again to the tree as soon as
she had gone. Then the flowers disappeared and two
large fruits came in their stead. The R&aacute;n&iacute; looked out of
her window: &ldquo;Oh, what delicious fruits! I&rsquo;ll eat them all
myself. I won&rsquo;t give a bit to anybody, and I&rsquo;ll eat them
by myself quite quietly.&rdquo; She went down to the garden,
but they flew high up into the sky, and then they came
down again. So this went on, day after day, until she got
so cross she ordered the tree to be cut down. But it was
of no use. The tree was cut down, but the fruits flew high
up into the sky, and in the night the tree grew up again
and the fruits came back again to it. And so this went on
for many days. Every day she cut down the tree, and every
night it grew up again, but she could never get the fruits.
At last she became very angry, and had the tree hewn into
tiny bits and all the bits thrown away, but still the tree
grew again in the night, and in the morning the fruits were
hanging on it. So she went to the R&aacute;j&aacute; and told him that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
in the garden was a tree with two fruits, and every time
she tried to get them, the fruits went up into the air. She
had had the tree cut down ever so many times, and it
always grew up again in the night and the fruits returned
to it. &ldquo;Why cannot you leave the tree alone?&rdquo; said the
R&aacute;j&aacute;. &ldquo;But I should like to see if what you say is true.&rdquo;
So the R&aacute;j&aacute; and the R&aacute;n&iacute; went down to the garden, and
the R&aacute;n&iacute; tried to get the fruits, but she could not, for they
went right up into the air.</p>

<p>That evening the R&aacute;j&aacute; went alone to the garden to gather
the fruits, and the fruits of themselves fell into his hand.
He took them into his room, and putting them on a little
table close to his bed, he lay down to sleep. As soon as
he was in bed a little voice inside one of the fruits said,
&ldquo;Brother;&rdquo; and a little voice in the other fruit said,
&ldquo;Sister, speak more gently. To-morrow the R&aacute;j&aacute; will
break open the fruits, and if the R&aacute;n&iacute; finds us she will kill
us. Three times has God made us alive again, but if we
die a fourth time he will bring us to life no more.&rdquo; The
R&aacute;j&aacute; listened and said, &ldquo;I will break them open in a little
while.&rdquo; Then he went to sleep, and after a little he woke
and said, &ldquo;A little while longer,&rdquo; and went to sleep again.
Several times he woke up and said, &ldquo;I will break the
fruits open in a little while,&rdquo; and went to sleep. At last he
took a knife and began cutting the fruits open very fast,
and the little boy cried, &ldquo;Gently, gently, father; you hurt
us!&rdquo; So then the R&aacute;j&aacute; cut more gently, and he stopped
to ask, &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; and they said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; And then
he cut again and asked, &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; and they said,
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; And a third time he asked, &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; and
they answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then the fruits broke open and
his two children jumped out. They rushed into their
father&rsquo;s arms, and he clasped them tight, and they cried
softly, that the R&aacute;n&iacute; might not hear.</p>

<p>He shut his room up close, and fed and dressed his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
children, and then went out of the room, locking the door
behind him. He had a little wooden house built that could
easily catch fire, and as soon as it was ready he went to the
R&aacute;n&iacute; and said, &ldquo;Will you go into a little house I have
made ready for you while your room is getting repaired?&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;n&iacute;; so she went into the little
house, and that night a man set it on fire, and the R&aacute;n&iacute;
and everything in it was burnt up. Then the Pomegranate
R&aacute;j&aacute; took her bones, put them into a tin box, and sent
them as a present to her mother. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the mother,
&ldquo;my daughter has married the Pomegranate Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;,
and so she sends me some delicious food.&rdquo; When she
opened the box, to her horror she found only bones!
Then she wrote to the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;, &ldquo;Of what use are bones?&rdquo;
The Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; wrote back, &ldquo;They are your bones; they
belong to you, for they are your daughter&rsquo;s bones. She
ill-treated and killed my children, and so I had her burnt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Pomegranate R&aacute;j&aacute; and his children lived very happily
for some time, and their dead mother, the Gul&iacute;an&aacute;r R&aacute;n&iacute;,
having a wish to see her husband and her children, prayed
to God to let her go and visit them. God said she could
go, but not in her human shape, so he changed her into a
beautiful bird, and put a pin in her head, and said, &ldquo;As
soon as the pin is pulled out you will become a woman again.&rdquo;
She flew to the palace where the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; lived, and there
were great trees about the palace. On one of these she
perched at night. The doorkeeper was lying near it. She
called out, &ldquo;Doorkeeper! doorkeeper!&rdquo; and he answered,
&ldquo;What is it? Who is it?&rdquo; And she asked, &ldquo;Is the R&aacute;j&aacute;
well?&rdquo; and the doorkeeper said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are the children
well?&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;And all the servants, and
camels, and horses?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you well?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Have you had plenty of food?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;What a great
donkey your Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; is!&rdquo; And then she began to cry very
much, and pearls fell from her eyes as she cried. Then she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
began to laugh very much, and great big rubies fell from
her beak as she laughed. The next morning the doorkeeper
got up and felt about, and said, &ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo;
meaning the pearls and the rubies, for he did not know what
they were. &ldquo;I will keep them.&rdquo; So he picked them all up
and put them into a corner of his house. Every night the
bird came and asked after the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; and the children
and the servants, and left a great many pearls and rubies
behind her. At last the doorkeeper had a whole heap of
pearls and rubies.</p>

<p>One day a Fak&iacute;r came and begged, and as the doorkeeper
had no pice, or flour, or rice to give, he gave him a handful
of pearls and rubies. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Fak&iacute;r to himself,
&ldquo;I am sure these are pearls and rubies.&rdquo; So he tied them
up in his cloth. Then he went to the R&aacute;j&aacute; to beg, and
the R&aacute;j&aacute; gave him a handful of rice. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the
Fak&iacute;r, &ldquo;the great Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; only gives me a handful of rice
when his doorkeeper gives me pearls and rubies!&rdquo; and
he turned to walk away. But the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; stopped him.
&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that my doorkeeper gave
you pearls and rubies?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Fak&iacute;r, &ldquo;your doorkeeper
gave me pearls and rubies.&rdquo; So the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; went
to the doorkeeper&rsquo;s house, and when he saw all the pearls
and rubies that were there, he thought the man had stolen
them from his treasury. The Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; had not as many
pearls and rubies as his doorkeeper had. Then turning to
the doorkeeper he asked him to tell him truly where and how
he had got them. &ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; said the doorkeeper.
&ldquo;Every night a beautiful bird comes and asks after you,
after your children, after all your elephants, horses, and
servants; and then it cries, and when it cries pearls drop
from its eyes; and then it laughs, and rubies fall from its
beak. If you come to-night I dare say you will see it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Pomegranate R&aacute;j&aacute;.</p>

<p>So that night the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; pulled his bed out under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
tree on which the bird always perched. At night the bird
came and called out, &ldquo;Doorkeeper! doorkeeper!&rdquo; and the
doorkeeper answered, &ldquo;Yes, lord.&rdquo; And the bird said, &ldquo;Is
your Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; well?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are the children well?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;And all his servants, horses, and camels and
elephants&mdash;are they well?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you well?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you had plenty of food?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What a fool your Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; is!&rdquo; And then she cried, and
the pearls came tumbling down on the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s eyes, and
the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; opened one eye and saw what a beautiful
bird it was. And then it laughed, and rubies fell from its
beak on to the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;.</p>

<p>Next morning the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; said he would give any one
who would catch the bird as much money as he wanted. So
he called a fisherman, and asked him to bring his net and
catch the bird when it came that night. The fisherman said
he would for one thousand rupees. That night the fisherman,
the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;, and the doorkeeper, all waited under
the tree. Soon the bird came, and asked after the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;,
after his children, and all his servants and elephants, and
camels and horses, and then after the doorkeeper, and then
it called the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; a fool. Then it cried, and then it
laughed, and just as it laughed the fisherman threw the net
over the bird and caught it. Then they shut it up in an
iron cage, and the next morning the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; took it out
and stroked it, and said, &ldquo;What a sweet little bird! what a
lovely little bird!&rdquo; And the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; felt something like a
pin in its head, and he gave a pull, and out came the pin,
and then his own dear wife, the Pomegranate-flower R&aacute;n&iacute;,
stood before him. The R&aacute;j&aacute; was exceedingly glad, and so
were his two children. And there were great rejoicings,
and they lived happily ever after.</p>

THE CAT AND THE DOG.</h2>


<h3><i>Introduction.</i></h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#niii">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapn"><span class="dcap">N</span></span>OW all cats are aunts to the tigers, and the cat in
this story was the aunt of the tiger in this story.
She was his mother&rsquo;s sister. When the tiger&rsquo;s
mother was dying, she called the cat to her, and taking her
paw she said, &ldquo;When I am dead you must take care of my
child.&rdquo; The cat answered, &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and then the tiger&rsquo;s
mother died. The tiger said to the cat, &ldquo;Aunt, I am very
hungry. Go and fetch some fire. When I go to ask men
for fire they are afraid of me, and run away from me, and
won&rsquo;t give me any. But you are such a little creature that
men are not afraid of you, and so they will give you fire,
and then you must bring it to me.&rdquo; So the cat said, &ldquo;Very
good,&rdquo; and off she started, and went into a house where
some men were eating their dinner: they had thrown away
the bones, and the cat began to eat them. This house was
very near the place where the tiger lived, and on peeping
round the corner he saw his aunt eating the bones. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I sent my aunt to fetch fire that I might cook my
dinner as I am very hungry, and there she sits eating the
bones, and never thinks of me.&rdquo; So the tiger called out,
&ldquo;Aunt, I sent you to fetch fire, and there you sit eating
bones and leave me hungry! If ever you come near me
again, I will kill you at once.&rdquo; So the cat ran away screaming,
&ldquo;I will never go near the tiger again, for he will kill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
me!&rdquo; This is why all cats are so afraid of tigers, or of anything
like a tiger. And this is why, when the cat in the
story saw the tiger, her nephew, fighting with the man, she
ran away as hard as she could.</p>


<h3><i>The Story.</i></h3>

<p>There were once a dog and a cat. It was a very rainy day,
and some men were eating their dinner inside their house.
The cat sat inside too, eating her dinner, and the dog sat on
the door-step. The cat called out to the dog, &ldquo;I am a high-caste
person, and you are a very low-caste person.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
said the dog, &ldquo;not at all. I am the high-caste person and
you are of very low caste. You eat all the men&rsquo;s dinner up,
and snatch the food from their hands just as they are putting
it into their mouths. And you scratch them, and they
beat you; while I sit away from them, and so they don&rsquo;t
beat me. And if they <em>give</em> me any dinner I&rsquo;ll eat it; but if
they don&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says the cat, &ldquo;not a bit of it.
I eat nice clean food; but you eat nasty, dirty food, which
the men have thrown away.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the dog, &ldquo;I am
high caste and you are very low caste, for if I gave you a
slap you would tumble down directly.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said
the cat. And they went on disputing and began to fight, till
the dog said, &ldquo;Very well, let us go to the wise jackal and
ask him which of us is the better.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the cat.
So they went to the jackal and asked him. Said the cat, &ldquo;I
am of the higher caste, and the dog is of the lower caste.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the jackal, &ldquo;the dog is of the higher caste.&rdquo;
The cat said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and the jackal said, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and they
began to fight. Then the jackal and the dog proposed to
go and ask a great big beast who lived in the jungle and
was like a tiger. But the cat said, &ldquo;I cannot go near a
tiger or anything like one.&rdquo; So then they said, &ldquo;When we
come near the beast, you can remain behind, and we will go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
on and speak to him.&rdquo; So they ran into the jungle, where
there was a tiger who had been lying on the ground with a
great thorn sticking in his foot. When his aunt, the cat,
saw him, she scampered off, for she was dreadfully
frightened.</p>

<p>The thorn had given the tiger great pain; for a long while
he could get no one to take it out, so had lain there for
days. At last he had seen a man passing by, to whom he
called and said, &ldquo;Take out this thorn, and I promise I
won&rsquo;t eat you.&rdquo; But the man refused through fear, saying,
&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t, for you will eat me.&rdquo; Three times the tiger
had promised not to eat him; so at last the man took out
the thorn. Then the tiger sprang up and said, &ldquo;Now I will
eat you, for I am very hungry.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; said the
man. &ldquo;What a liar you are! You promised not to eat me
if I would take the thorn out of your foot, and now that I
have done so you say you will eat me.&rdquo; And they began to
fight, and the man said, &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t eat me, I will bring
you a cow and a goat.&rdquo; But the tiger refused, saying, &ldquo;No,
I won&rsquo;t eat them; I will eat you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment the jackal and the dog came up. And
the jackal asked, &ldquo;What is the matter? why are you fighting?&rdquo;
So then the man told him why they were fighting;
and the jackal said to the tiger, &ldquo;I will tell you a good way
of eating the man. Go and fetch a big bag.&rdquo; So the tiger
went and fetched the bag, and brought it to the jackal.
Then the jackal said, &ldquo;Get inside the bag, and leave its
mouth open and I&rsquo;ll throw the man in to you.&rdquo; So the tiger
got inside the bag, and the jackal, the dog and the man
quickly tied it up as tight as they could. Then they began
to beat the tiger with all their might until at last they killed
him. Then the man went home, and the jackal went home,
and the dog went home.</p>

THE CAT WHICH COULD NOT BE KILLED.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#niv">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapt"><span class="dcap">T</span></span>HERE were once a dog and a cat, who were always
quarrelling. The dog used to beat the cat, but he
never could hurt her. She would only dance about
and cry, &ldquo;You never hurt me, you never hurt me! I <em>had</em>
a pain in my shoulder, but now it is all gone away.&rdquo; So the
dog went to a <i>main&aacute;</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and said, &ldquo;What shall I do to hurt
this cat? I beat her and I bite her, and yet I can&rsquo;t hurt her.
I am such a big dog and she is rather a big cat, yet if I
beat her I don&rsquo;t hurt her, but if she beats me she hurts me
so much.&rdquo; The <i>main&aacute;</i> said, &ldquo;Bite her mouth very, very
hard, and then you&rsquo;ll hurt her.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the cat,
who had just come up, laughing; &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t hurt me at
all.&rdquo; The dog bit her mouth as hard as he could. &ldquo;Oh,
you don&rsquo;t hurt me,&rdquo; said the cat, dancing about. So the
dog went again to the <i>main&aacute;</i> and said, &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bite her ears,&rdquo; said the <i>main&aacute;</i>. So the dog bit the cat&rsquo;s
ears, but she danced about and said, &ldquo;Oh, you did not hurt
me; now I can put earrings in my ears.&rdquo; So she put in
earrings.</p>

<p>The dog went to the elephant. &ldquo;Can you kill this cat?
she worries me so every day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said the elephant,
&ldquo;of course I can kill her. She is so little and I am so big.&rdquo;
Then the elephant came and took her up with his trunk, and
threw her a long way. Up she jumped at once and danced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
about, saying, &ldquo;You did not hurt me one bit. I <em>had</em> a pain,
but now I am quite well.&rdquo; Then the elephant got cross and
said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you to dance in another way than that,&rdquo;
and he took the cat and laid her on the ground and put his
great foot on her. But she was not hurt at all. She danced
about and said, &ldquo;You did not hurt me one bit, not one
bit,&rdquo; and she dug her claws into the elephant&rsquo;s trunk. The
elephant ran away screaming, and he told the dog, &ldquo;You
had better beware of that cat. She belongs to the tiger
tribe.&rdquo; The dog felt very angry with the cat. &ldquo;What shall
I do,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to kill this cat?&rdquo; And he bit her nose so
hard that it bled. But she laughed at him. &ldquo;Now I can
put a ring in my nose,&rdquo; said she. He got furious. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
bite her tail in half,&rdquo; said he. So he bit her tail in half,
and yet he did not hurt her.</p>

<p>He then went to a leopard. &ldquo;If you can kill this cat I
will give you anything you want.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll kill
her,&rdquo; said the leopard. And they went together to the cat.
&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said the cat to the leopard; &ldquo;I want to speak to
you first. I&rsquo;ll give you something to eat, and then I&rsquo;ll tell
you what I want to say.&rdquo; And then she ran off ever so far,
and after she had run a mile she stopped and danced, calling
out, &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ll give you nothing to eat; you could not
kill me.&rdquo; The leopard went away very cross, and saying,
&ldquo;What a clever cat that is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dog next went to a man, and said, &ldquo;Can you kill this
cat, she worries me so?&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course I can,&rdquo; said the man;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick this knife into her stomach.&rdquo; And he stuck his
knife into the cat&rsquo;s stomach, but the cat jumped up, and her
stomach closed, and the man went home.</p>

<p>And the dog went to a bear. &ldquo;Can <em>you</em> kill this cat? I
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill her,&rdquo; said the bear; so he stuck all his
claws into the cat, but he didn&rsquo;t hurt her; and she stuck her
claws into the bear&rsquo;s nose so deep that he died immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
Then the poor dog felt very unhappy, and went and threw
himself into a hole, and there he died, while the cat went
away to her friends.</p>

THE JACKAL AND THE KITE.</h2>


<p><span class="dcapt"><span class="dcap">T</span></span>HERE was once a she-jackal and a she-kite. They
lived in the same tree; the jackal at the bottom of
the tree, and the kite at the top. Neither had
any children. One day the kite said to the jackal, &ldquo;Let us
go and worship God, and fast, and then he will give us
children.&rdquo; So the jackal said, &ldquo;Very good.&rdquo; That day the
kite ate nothing, nor that night; but the jackal at night
brought a dead animal, and was sitting eating it quietly
under the tree. By-and-by the kite heard her crunching
the bones, instead of fasting. &ldquo;What have you got there,&rdquo;
said the kite, &ldquo;that you are making such a noise?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;
said the jackal; &ldquo;it is only my own bones that
rattle inside my body whenever I move.&rdquo; The kite went to
sleep again, and took no more notice of the jackal. Next
morning the kite ate some food in the name of God. That
night again the jackal brought a dead animal. The kite
called out, &ldquo;What are you crunching there? Why are you
making that noise? I am sure you have something to eat.&rdquo;
The jackal said, &ldquo;Oh, no! It is only my own bones rattling
in my body.&rdquo; So the kite went to sleep again.</p>

<p>Some time after, the kite had seven little boys&mdash;real little
boys&mdash;but the jackal had none, because she had not fasted.
A year after that the kite went and worshipped God, asking
Him to take care of her children. One day&mdash;it was their
great day&mdash;the kite set out seven plates. On one she put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
cocoa-nuts, on another cucumbers, on a third rice, on a fourth
plantains, and so on. Then she gave a plate to each of her
seven sons, and told them to take the plates to their aunt the
jackal. So they took the seven plates, and carried them to
their aunt, crying out, &ldquo;Aunty, aunty, look here! Mamma
has sent you these things.&rdquo; The jackal took the plates, and
cut off the heads of the seven boys, and their hands, and
their feet, and their noses, and their ears, and took out their
eyes. Then she laid their heads in one plate, and their eyes
in another, and their noses in a third, and their ears in a
fourth, and their hands in a fifth, and their feet in a sixth,
and their trunks in the seventh, and then she covered all the
plates over. Then she took the plates to the kite, and called
out, &ldquo;Here! I have brought you something in return. You
sent me a present, and I bring you a present.&rdquo; Now the
poor kite thought the jackal had killed all her seven children,
so she cried out, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s too dark now to see what you
have brought. Put the plates down in my tree.&rdquo; The
jackal put the plates down and went home. Then God
made the boys alive again, and they came running to their
mother, quite well. And instead of the heads and eyes, and
noses and ears, and hands and feet, and trunks, there were
again on the plates cocoa-nuts and cucumbers, and plantains
and rice, and so on.</p>

<p>Now the jackal got hold of the boys again. And this
time she killed them, and cooked them and ate them; and
again God brought them to life. Well, the jackal was very
much astonished to see the boys alive, and she got angry,
and said to the kite, &ldquo;I will take your seven sons and throw
them into the water, and they will be drowned.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very
well,&rdquo; said the kite, &ldquo;take them. I don&rsquo;t mind. God will
take care of them.&rdquo; The jackal took them and threw them
into the water, and left them to die, while the kite looked
on without crying. And again God made them alive, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
the jackal was so surprised. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I put
these children into the water, and left them to drown. And
here they are alive!&rdquo; Then God got very angry with the
jackal, and said to her, &ldquo;Go out of this village. And wherever
you go, men will try to shoot you, and you shall always
be afraid of them.&rdquo; So the jackal had to go away; and the
kite and her children lived very happily ever afterwards.</p>

THE VORACIOUS FROG.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nvi">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapt"><span class="dcap">T</span></span>HERE were a rat and a frog. And the rat said to
the frog, &ldquo;Go and get me some sticks, while I go
and get some flour and milk.&rdquo; So the frog went
out far into the jungle and brought home plenty of sticks,
and the rat went out and brought home flour and milk for
their dinner. Then she cooked the dinner, and when it was
cooked she said to the frog, &ldquo;Now, you sit here while I go
to bathe, and take care of the food so that no one may come
and eat it up.&rdquo; Then the rat went to take her bath, and as
soon as she had gone the frog made haste and ate up the
dinner quickly, and went away.</p>

<p>When the rat came back she found no dinner, and she
could not find the frog. So she went out to look for him,
calling to him as loudly as she could, and she saw him in
the distance, and overtook him. &ldquo;Why have you eaten my
dinner? Why did you go away?&rdquo; said the rat. Said the
frog, &ldquo;Oh, dear! it was not I that ate your dinner, but a
huge dog that came; and I was only a tiny, tiny thing, and
he was a great big dog, and so he frightened me, and I ran
away.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the rat; &ldquo;go and fetch me more
sticks while I go for flour and milk.&rdquo; So the frog went out
far into the jungle and brought back plenty of sticks. And
the rat went to fetch flour and milk. Then she lit the
fire and cooked the dinner, and told the frog to take care of
the dinner while she went to bathe. As soon as she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
gone, the frog ate up all the dinner, and went away and hid
himself. When the rat came back she saw no frog, no dinner.
She went away into the jungle and called to him, and the
frog answered from behind a tree, &ldquo;Here I am, here I am.&rdquo;
The rat went to him and said, &ldquo;Why did you eat my dinner?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the frog. &ldquo;It was a great big dog
ate the dinner, and he wanted to eat me too, and so I ran
away.&rdquo; The rat said, &ldquo;Very well. Go and fetch me some
more sticks, and I will go for flour and milk.&rdquo; Then she
cooked the dinner again and went to bathe. The frog ate
up all the dinner, and went away and hid himself. When
the rat returned she saw no dinner, no frog. So she went
far into the jungle, found the frog, and told him that it was
he that had eaten the dinner. And the frog said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
and the rat said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And the frog said, &ldquo;If you say
that again, I will eat you up.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; says the rat,
&ldquo;eat me up.&rdquo; So he ate her up and sat behind a tree, and
the baker came past. The frog called out, &ldquo;Baker, come
here! come here! Give me some bread.&rdquo; The baker looked
about everywhere, could not see anybody, could not think
who was calling him. At last he saw the frog sitting behind
a tree. &ldquo;Give me some bread,&rdquo; says the frog. The man
said, &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t give you any bread. I am a great big
man, and you are only a little frog, and you have no money.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, I have money. I will give you some pice, and you
will give me some bread.&rdquo; But the man said, &ldquo;No, I
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the frog, &ldquo;if you won&rsquo;t give me bread,
I will eat you up first, and then I will eat up your bread.&rdquo;
So he ate up the man, and then ate up his bread. Presently
a man with oranges and lemons passed by. The frog called
to him, &ldquo;Come here! come here!&rdquo; The man was very
much afraid. He didn&rsquo;t know who had called him. Then
he saw the frog, and the frog said, &ldquo;Give me some lemons.&rdquo;
The man wouldn&rsquo;t, and said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; says the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
frog, &ldquo;if you won&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll eat you up.&rdquo; So he ate up the man
with his lemons and oranges. Presently a horse and his
groom went by. The frog says, &ldquo;Please give me a ride, and
I will give you some money.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the horse, &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t let you ride on me. You are like a monkey,&mdash;very
little&mdash;I won&rsquo;t let you ride on my back.&rdquo; The frog said,
&ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll eat you up.&rdquo; Then the frog ate him up,
and his groom too. Then a barber passed by. &ldquo;Come
and shave me,&rdquo; says the frog. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; says the barber,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come and shave you.&rdquo; So he shaved him, and he
thought the frog looked <em>very</em> fat, and so as he was shaving
him he suddenly made a cut in his stomach. Out jumped
the rat with her flour and milk&mdash;the baker with his bread&mdash;the
lemon-seller with his oranges and lemons&mdash;the horse and
his groom. And the barber ran away home. And the frog
died.</p>

THE STORY OF FOOLISH SACH&Uacute;L&Iacute;.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nvii">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapt"><span class="dcap">T</span></span>HERE once lived a poor old widow woman named
Hungn&iacute;, who had a little idiot son called Sach&uacute;l&iacute;.
She used to beg every day. One day when the
son had grown up, he said to his mother. &ldquo;What makes
women laugh?&rdquo; &ldquo;If you throw a tiny stone at them,&rdquo;
answered she, &ldquo;they will laugh.&rdquo; So one day Sach&uacute;l&iacute; went
and sat by a well, and three women came to it to fill their
water-jars. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Sach&uacute;l&iacute; &ldquo;I will make one of these
women laugh.&rdquo; Two of the women filled their water-jars
and went away home, and he threw no stones at them; but
as the last, who also had on the most jewels, passed him,
he threw a great big stone at her, and she fell down dead,
with her mouth set as if she were smiling. &ldquo;Oh, look!
look! how she is laughing!&rdquo; said Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, and he ran off to
call his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come, mother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and see how I have
made this woman laugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mother came, and when she saw the woman lying
dead, she was much frightened, for the dead woman belonged
to a great and very rich family, and she wore jewels worth a
thousand rupees. Hungn&iacute; took off all her jewels, and threw
her body into the well.</p>

<p>After some days the dead woman&rsquo;s father and mother and
all her people sent round a crier with a drum to try and
find her. &ldquo;Whoever brings back a young woman who
wears a great many gold necklaces and bracelets and rings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
shall get a great deal of money,&rdquo; cried the crier. Sach&uacute;l&iacute;
heard him. &ldquo;I know where she is,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My mother
took off all her jewels, and threw her into the well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crier said, &ldquo;Can you go down into the well and bring
her up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will tie a rope round my waist and let me down
the well, I shall be able to bring her up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they set off towards the well, which was near Hungn&iacute;&rsquo;s
house; and when she saw them coming, she guessed what
they came for, and she ran out and killed a sheep, threw it
into the well, and took out the dead woman and hid her.</p>

<p>The crier got some men to come with him, and they let
Sach&uacute;l&iacute; down the well. &ldquo;Has she got eyes?&rdquo; said Sach&uacute;l&iacute;.
&ldquo;Of course, every one has eyes,&rdquo; answered the men. &ldquo;Has
she a nose?&rdquo; asked Sach&uacute;l&iacute;. &ldquo;Yes, she has a nose,&rdquo; said
the men. &ldquo;Has she got a mouth?&rdquo; asked Sach&uacute;l&iacute;. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said the men. &ldquo;Has she a long face?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he mean?&rdquo; said the men, who were getting
cross. &ldquo;No one has a long face; perhaps she has, though.
Yes, she has a long face,&rdquo; cried the men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she a tail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tail! Why no one has a tail. Perhaps, though, she
has long hair. No doubt that is what he calls a tail. Yes,
she has a tail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she ears?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, every one has ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she four feet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four feet!&rdquo; said the men. &ldquo;Why, no one has four feet.
Perhaps you call her hands feet. Yes, she has four feet.
Bring her up quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Sach&uacute;l&iacute; brought up the sheep.</p>

<p>The men were very angry when they saw the sheep, and
they beat Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, and called him a very stupid fellow and a
great liar, and they went away feeling very cross.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
Sach&uacute;l&iacute; went home to his mother, who, as soon as she saw
him coming, ran out and put the woman&rsquo;s body back in the
well, and when he got home she beat him. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;give me some bread, and I will go away and die.&rdquo; His
mother cooked him some bread, and he went away.</p>

<p>He walked on, and on, and on, a long way.</p>

<p>Now, some R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s ten camels had been travelling along
the road on which Sach&uacute;l&iacute; went, each carrying sacks of gold
mohurs and rupees, and one of these camels broke loose
from the string and strayed away, and the camel-drivers
could not find it again. But Sach&uacute;l&iacute; met it, and caught it
and took it home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, mother! see what a quantity of money I have brought
you!&rdquo; cried Sach&uacute;l&iacute;. Hungn&iacute; rushed out, and was delighted
to see so much money. She took off the sacks at once and
sent the camel away. Then she hid the rupees and the gold
with the jewels she had taken from the dead woman. And,
as she was a cunning woman, she went and bought a great
many comfits and scattered them all about her house, when
Sach&uacute;l&iacute; was out of the way. &ldquo;Oh, look! look!&rdquo; cried
Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, &ldquo;at all these comfits.&rdquo; &ldquo;God has rained them from
heaven,&rdquo; said his mother. Sach&uacute;l&iacute; began to pick them up
and eat them, and he told all the people in the village how
God had rained down comfits from heaven on his mother&rsquo;s
house. &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; cried they. &ldquo;Yes, he has,&rdquo; said
Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, &ldquo;and I have been eating them.&rdquo; &ldquo;No comfits have
fallen on our houses,&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;the
day my mother got all those rupees, God rained comfits on
our house.&rdquo; &ldquo;What lies!&rdquo; cried the people; &ldquo;as if it ever
rained comfits. Why did not the comfits rain down on our
houses? Why did they fall only on your house? And what&rsquo;s
all this about rupees?&rdquo; And then they came to see if there
were any rupees or comfits in Hungn&iacute;&rsquo;s house, and they found
none at all, for Hungn&iacute; had hidden the rupees and thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
away the comfits. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said they to Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, &ldquo;where
are your rupees? where are your comfits? What a liar you
are! as if it ever rained comfits. How can you tell such
stories?&rdquo; And they beat him. &ldquo;But it did rain comfits,&rdquo;
said Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, &ldquo;for I ate them. It rained comfits the day
my mother got the rupees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the R&aacute;j&aacute; who had lost his camel sent round the crier
with his drum to find his camel and his money-bags. &ldquo;Whoever
has found a camel carrying money-bags and brings it
and the money back to the R&aacute;j&aacute;, will get a great many rupees,&rdquo;
cried the crier. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; says Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, &ldquo;I know where the
money is. One day I went out and I found a stray camel,
and he had sacks of rupees on his back, and I took him
home to my mother, and she took the sacks off his back and
sent the camel away.&rdquo; So the crier went to find the rupees,
and the people in the bazar went with him. But Hungn&iacute;
had hidden the rupees so carefully that, though they hunted
all over her house, they could find none, and they beat
Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, and told him he was a liar. &ldquo;I am not telling lies,&rdquo;
said Sach&uacute;l&iacute;. &ldquo;My mother took the rupees the day it rained
comfits on our house.&rdquo; So they beat him again, and they
went away. Then Hungn&iacute; beat Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, and said, &ldquo;What
a bad boy you are! trying to get me beaten and put into
prison, telling every one about the rupees. Go away; I
don&rsquo;t want you any more, such a bad boy as you are! go
away and die.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Very well, mother; give me
some bread, and I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sach&uacute;l&iacute; set off and took an axe with him. &ldquo;How shall
I kill myself?&rdquo; said he. So he climbed up a tree and sat
out on a long branch, and began cutting off the branch between
himself and the tree on which he was sitting. &ldquo;What
are you doing up there?&rdquo; said a man who came by. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
die if you cut that branch off.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; cries
Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, jumping down on the man, and seizing his hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
&ldquo;When shall I die?&rdquo; &ldquo;How can I tell? Let me go.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t let you go till you tell me when I shall die.&rdquo; And at
last the man said, &ldquo;When you find a scarlet thread on your
jacket, then you will die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sach&uacute;l&iacute; went off to the bazar, and sat down by some
tailors, and one of the tailors, in throwing away their shreds
of cloth, threw a scarlet thread on Sach&uacute;l&iacute;&rsquo;s coat. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
said Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, when he saw the thread, &ldquo;now I shall die!&rdquo;
&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; said the tailors. &ldquo;A man
told me that when I found a scarlet thread on my jacket,
I should die,&rdquo; said Sach&uacute;l&iacute;; and the tailors all laughed
at him and made fun of him, but he went off into the jungle
and dug his grave with his axe, and lay down in it. In
the night a sepoy came by with a large jar of ghee on his
head. &ldquo;How heavy this jar is,&rdquo; said the sepoy. &ldquo;Is there
no cooly that will come and carry my ghee home for me?
I would give him four pice for his trouble.&rdquo; Up jumped
Sach&uacute;l&iacute; out of his grave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry it for you,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said the sepoy, much frightened. &ldquo;Oh, I am
a man who is dead,&rdquo; said Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, &ldquo;and I am tired of lying
here. I can&rsquo;t lie here any more.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the sepoy,
very much frightened, &ldquo;you may carry my ghee.&rdquo; So Sach&uacute;l&iacute;
put the jar on his head, and he went on, with the sepoy
following. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, &ldquo;with these four pice I will
buy a hen, and I will sell the hen and her eggs, and with the
money I get for them I will buy a goat; and then I will sell
the goat and her milk and her hide and buy a cow, and I will
sell her milk; and then I will marry a wife, and then I shall
have some children, and they will say to me, &lsquo;Father, will
you have some rice?&rsquo; and I will say, &lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t have any
rice.&rsquo;&rdquo; And as he said, &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t have any rice,&rdquo; he shook
his head, and down came the jar of ghee, and the jar was
smashed, and the ghee spilled. &ldquo;Oh, dear! what have you
done?&rdquo; cried the sepoy. &ldquo;Why did you shake your head?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
&ldquo;Because my children asked me to have some rice, and I
did not want any, so I shook my head,&rdquo; said Sach&uacute;l&iacute;. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
said the sepoy, &ldquo;he is an utter idiot.&rdquo; And the sepoy went
home, and Sach&uacute;l&iacute; went back to his mother. &ldquo;Why have
you come back?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I have been dead twelve years,&rdquo;
said Sach&uacute;l&iacute;. &ldquo;What lies you tell!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You have only
been away a few days. Be off! I don&rsquo;t want any liars here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sach&uacute;l&iacute; asked her to give him two flour-cakes, which she
did, and he went off to the jungle, and it was night. Five
fairies lived in this jungle, and as Sach&uacute;l&iacute; went along, he
broke his flour-cakes into five pieces, and said, &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll eat
one, then the second, then the third, then the fourth, and then
the fifth.&rdquo; And the fairies heard him and were afraid, and
said to each other, &ldquo;What shall we do? Here is this man,
and he is going to eat us all up. What shall we do to save
ourselves? We will give him something.&rdquo; So they went out
all five, and said to Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, &ldquo;If only you won&rsquo;t eat us, we
will give you a present.&rdquo; Now Sach&uacute;l&iacute; did not know there
were fairies in this jungle. &ldquo;What will you give me?&rdquo; said
Sach&uacute;l&iacute;. &ldquo;We will give you a cooking-pot. When you want
anything to eat, all you have to do is to ask the pot for it,
and you will get it.&rdquo; Sach&uacute;l&iacute; took the pot and went off to
the bazar. He stopped at a cook-shop, and asked for some
pilau. &ldquo;Pilau? There&rsquo;s no pilau here,&rdquo; said the shopman.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, &ldquo;I have a cooking-pot here, and I
have only to ask it for any dish I want, and I get it at once.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Just see,&rdquo; said Sach&uacute;l&iacute;;
and he said to the cooking-pot, &ldquo;I want some pilau,&rdquo; and
immediately the pot was full of pilau, and all the people in
the shop set to work to help him to eat it up, it was so good.
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; thought the cook, &ldquo;I must have that pot,&rdquo; so he gave
Sach&uacute;l&iacute; a sleepy drink. Then Sach&uacute;l&iacute; went to sleep, and
while he slept the cook stole the fairy cooking-pot, and put
a common cooking-pot in its place. Sach&uacute;l&iacute; went home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
with the cook&rsquo;s pot, and said, &ldquo;Mother, I have brought
home a cooking-pot. If you ask it for any food you want,
you will get it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Hungn&iacute;; &ldquo;what lies you
are telling!&rdquo; &ldquo;It is quite true, mother; only see,&rdquo; and he
asked the pot for different dishes, but none came. Hungn&iacute;
was furious. &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why do you come
back to me? I want no liars here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Give me five flour-cakes
and I will go,&rdquo; said her son. So she baked the bread
for him, and he set off for the jungle where he had met the
five fairies, and as he went along he said, &ldquo;I will eat one,
and I will eat two, and I will eat three, and I will eat four,
and I will eat five.&rdquo; The five fairies heard him, and were
terrified. &ldquo;Here is this bad man again,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;and he
will eat us all five. Oh, what shall we do? Let us give
him a present.&rdquo; So they went to Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, and said, &ldquo;Here is
a box for you. Whenever you want any clothes you have
only to tell this box, and it will give them to you; take it,
and don&rsquo;t eat us.&rdquo; So he took the box and went to the bazar,
and he stopped at the cook-shop again, and asked the cook
for a red silk dress, and a pair of long black silk trousers,
and a blue silk turban, and a pair of red shoes, and the
cook laughed and asked how he should have such beautiful
things. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, &ldquo;here is a box; when I ask
it for the dress and trousers, and turban and shoes, I shall
get them.&rdquo; So the cook laughed at him. &ldquo;Just see,&rdquo; said
Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, and he said, &ldquo;Box, give me a red silk dress and a
pair of long black silk trousers, and a blue silk turban, and
red shoes,&rdquo; and there they were at once. And the cook was
delighted, and said to himself, &ldquo;I will have that box,&rdquo; and he
gave Sach&uacute;l&iacute; a good dinner and a sleepy drink, and Sach&uacute;l&iacute;
fell fast asleep. While he slept the cook came and stole the
fairy box, and put a common box in its place. In the morning
Sach&uacute;l&iacute; went home to his mother and said, &ldquo;Mother, I&rsquo;ve
brought you a box. You have only to ask it for any clothes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
you may want, and you will get them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said
his mother, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tell me such lies.&rdquo; &ldquo;Only see, mother;
I am telling you truth,&rdquo; said he. He asked the box for coats
and all sorts of things&mdash;no; he got nothing. His mother
was very angry, and said, &ldquo;You liar! you naughty boy! Go
away and don&rsquo;t come back any more.&rdquo; And she broke the
box to pieces, and threw the bits away. &ldquo;Well, mother, bake
me some flour-cakes.&rdquo; So she baked him the cakes and
gave them to him, and sent him away. He went off to the
fairies&rsquo; jungle, and as he went he said, &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll eat one,
then two, then three, then four, then five.&rdquo; The five fairies
were very frightened. &ldquo;Here is this man come back to eat
us all five. Let us give him a present.&rdquo; So they went to
him and gave him a rope and stick, and said, &ldquo;Only say to
this rope, &lsquo;Bind that man,&rsquo; and he will be tied up at once;
and to this stick, &lsquo;Beat that man,&rsquo; and the stick will beat
him.&rdquo; Sach&uacute;l&iacute; was very glad to get these things, for he
guessed what had happened to his cooking-pot and box.
So he went to the bazar, and at the cook-shop he said, &ldquo;Rope,
bind all these men that are here!&rdquo; and the cook and every
one in the shop were tied up instantly. Then Sach&uacute;l&iacute; said,
&ldquo;Stick, beat these men!&rdquo; and the stick began to beat them.
&ldquo;Oh, stop, stop beating us, and untie, and I&rsquo;ll give you
your pot and your box!&rdquo; cried the cook. &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t
stop beating you, and I won&rsquo;t untie you till I have my pot
and my box.&rdquo; And the cook gave them both to him, and he
untied the rope. Then Sach&uacute;l&iacute; went home, and when his
mother saw him, she was very angry, but he showed her the
box and the cooking-pot, and she saw he had told her the
truth. So she sent for the doctor, and he declared Sach&uacute;l&iacute;
was wise and not silly, and he and Hungn&iacute; found a wife for
Sach&uacute;l&iacute;, and made a grand wedding for him, and they lived
happily ever after.</p>

BARBER H&Iacute;M AND THE TIGERS.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nviii">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapo"><span class="dcap">O</span></span>NCE there lived a barber called H&iacute;m, who was very
poor indeed. He had a wife and twelve children,
five boys and seven girls: now and then he got a
few pice. One day he went away from his home feeling very
cross, and left his wife and children to get on as best they
could. &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have not enough
money to buy food for my family, and they are crying for it.&rdquo;
And so he walked on till he came to a jungle. It was night
when he got there. This jungle was called the &ldquo;tigers&rsquo;
jungle,&rdquo; because only tigers lived in it; no birds, no insects,
no other animals, and there were four hundred tigers in it
altogether. As soon as Barber H&iacute;m reached the jungle he
saw a great tiger walking about. &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; cried
he. &ldquo;This tiger is sure to eat me.&rdquo; And he took his razor
and his razor-strap, and began to sharpen his razor. Then
he went close up to the tiger, still sharpening his razor. The
tiger was much frightened. &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; said the
tiger; &ldquo;this man will certainly gash me.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have come,&rdquo;
said the barber, &ldquo;to catch twenty tigers by order of Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;
K&aacute;ns. You are one, and I want nineteen more.&rdquo; The tiger,
greatly alarmed, answered, &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t catch us, I will give
you as much gold and as many jewels as you can carry.&rdquo;
For these tigers used to go out and carry off the men and
women from the villages, and some of these people had
rupees, and some had jewels, all of which the tigers used to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
collect together. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said H&iacute;m, &ldquo;then I won&rsquo;t catch
you.&rdquo; The tiger led him to the spot where all the tigers
used to eat their dinners, and the barber took as much gold
and as many jewels as he could carry, and set off home
with them.</p>

<p>Then he built a house, and bought his children pretty
clothes and good food, and necklaces, and they all lived very
happily for some time. But at last he wanted more rupees,
so he set off to the tigers&rsquo; jungle. There he met the tiger as
he did before, and he told him the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; K&aacute;ns had sent
him to catch twenty tigers. The tiger was terrified and said,
&ldquo;If you will only not catch us, I will give you more gold
and jewels.&rdquo; To this the barber agreed, and the tiger led
him to the old spot, and the barber took as many jewels and
rupees as he could carry. Then he returned home.</p>

<p>One day a very poor man, a fak&iacute;r, said to him, &ldquo;How did
you manage to become so rich? In old days you were so
poor you could hardly support your family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; said H&iacute;m. And he told him all about
his visits to the tigers&rsquo; jungle. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you go there for
gold to-night,&rdquo; continued the barber. &ldquo;Let me go and listen
to the tigers talking. If you like, you can come with me.
Only you must not be frightened if the tigers roar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be frightened,&rdquo; said the fak&iacute;r.</p>

<p>So that evening at eight o&rsquo;clock they went to the tigers&rsquo;
jungle. There the barber and the fak&iacute;r climbed into a tall
thick tree, and its leaves came all about them and sheltered
them as if they were in a house. The tigers used to hold
their councils under this tree. Very soon all the tigers in
the jungle assembled together under it, and their R&aacute;j&aacute;&mdash;a
great, huge beast, with only one eye&mdash;came too. &ldquo;Brothers,&rdquo;
said the tiger who had given the barber the rupees and
jewels, &ldquo;a man has come here twice to catch twenty of us for
the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; K&aacute;ns; now we are only four hundred in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
number, and if twenty of us were taken away we should be only
a small number, so I gave him each time as many rupees
and jewels as he could carry and he went away again. What
shall we do if he returns?&rdquo; The tigers said they would meet
again on the morrow, and then they would settle the matter.
Then the tigers went off, and the barber and the fak&iacute;r came
down from the tree. They took a quantity of rupees and
jewels and returned to their homes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;we will come again and hear
what the tigers say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day the barber went alone to the tigers&rsquo; jungle,
and there he met his tiger again. &ldquo;This time,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
am come to cut off the ears of all the four hundred tigers
who live in this jungle; for Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; K&aacute;ns wants them to
make into medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tiger was greatly frightened, much more so than at the
other times. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cut off our ears; pray don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;for then we could not hear, and it would hurt so horribly.
Go and cut off all the dogs&rsquo; ears instead, and I will give
you rupees and jewels as much as two men can carry.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the barber, and he made two journeys with
the rupees and jewels from the jungle to the borders of his
village, and there he got a cooly to help him to carry them
to his house.</p>

<p>At night he and the fak&iacute;r went again to the great tree under
which the tigers held their councils. Now the tiger who had
given the barber so many rupees and jewels had made ready
a great quantity of meat, fowls, chickens, geese, men the tigers
had killed&mdash;everything he had been able to get hold of&mdash;and
he made them into a heap under the tree, for he said that
after the tigers had settled the matter they would dine. Soon
the tigers arrived with their R&aacute;j&aacute;, and the barber&rsquo;s tiger said,
&ldquo;Brothers, what are we to do? This man came again to-day
to cut off all our ears to make medicine for Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; K&aacute;ns.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
I told him this would be a bad business for us, and that he
must go and cut off all the dogs&rsquo; ears instead; and I gave
him as much money and jewels as two men could carry.
So he went home. Now what shall we do? We must leave
this jungle, and where shall we go?&rdquo; The other tigers said,
&ldquo;We will not leave the jungle. If this man comes again we
will eat him up.&rdquo; So they dined and went away, saying they
would meet again to-morrow.</p>

<p>After the tigers had gone, the barber and fak&iacute;r came down
from the tree and went off to their homes, without taking
any rupees or jewels with them. They agreed to return the
next evening.</p>

<p>Next evening back they came and climbed into the great
tree. The tigers came too, and the barber&rsquo;s tiger told his
story all over again. The tiger R&aacute;j&aacute; sat up and said, fiercely,
&ldquo;We will not leave this jungle. Should the man come again,
I will eat him myself.&rdquo; When the fak&iacute;r heard this he was
so frightened that he tumbled down out of the tree into the
midst of the tigers. The barber instantly cried out with a
loud voice, &ldquo;Now cut off their ears! cut off their ears!&rdquo; and
the tigers, terrified, ran away as fast as they could. Then
the barber took the fak&iacute;r home, but the poor man was so
much hurt by his fall that he died.</p>

<p>The barber lived happily ever after, but he took good care
never to go to the tigers&rsquo; jungle again.</p>

THE BULBUL AND THE COTTON-TREE.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nix">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapt"><span class="dcap">T</span></span>HERE was once a bulbul, and one day as he was
flying about, he saw a tree on which was a little
fruit. The bulbul was much pleased and said, &ldquo;I
will sit here till this fruit is ripe, and then I will eat it.&rdquo; So
he deserted his nest and his wife, and sat there for twelve
years without eating anything, and every day he said, &ldquo;To-morrow
I will eat this fruit.&rdquo; During these twelve years a
great many birds tried to sit on the tree, and wished to build
their nests in it, but whenever they came the bulbul sent them
away, saying, &ldquo;This fruit is not good. Don&rsquo;t come here.&rdquo;
One day a cuckoo came and said, &ldquo;Why do you send us
away? Why should we not come and sit here too? All
the trees here are not yours.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the bulbul,
&ldquo;I am going to sit here, and when this fruit is ripe, I
shall eat it.&rdquo; Now the cuckoo knew that this tree was the
cotton-tree, but the bulbul did not. First comes the bud,
which the bulbul thought a fruit, then the flower, and the
flower becomes a big pod, and the pod bursts and all the
cotton flies away. The bulbul was delighted when he saw
the beautiful red flower, which he still thought a fruit, and
said, &ldquo;When it is ripe, it will be a delicious fruit.&rdquo; The flower
became a pod, and the pod burst. &ldquo;What is all this that is
flying about?&rdquo; said the bulbul. &ldquo;The fruit must be ripe
now.&rdquo; So he looked into the pod, and it was empty; all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
the cotton had fallen out. Then the cuckoo came and said
to the angry bulbul, &ldquo;You see if you had allowed us to
come and sit on the tree, you would have had something
good to eat; but as you were selfish, and would not let any
one share with you, God is angry and has punished you by
giving you a hollow fruit.&rdquo; Then the cuckoo called all the
other birds, and they came and mocked the bulbul. &ldquo;Ah!
you see God has punished you for your selfishness,&rdquo; they
said. The bulbul got very angry and all the birds went away.
After they had gone, the bulbul said to the tree, &ldquo;You are
a bad tree. You are of use to no one. You give food to
no one.&rdquo; The tree said, &ldquo;You are mistaken. God made
me what I am. My flower is given to sheep to eat. My
cotton makes pillows and mattresses for man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since that day no bulbul goes near a cotton-tree.</p>

THE MONKEY PRINCE.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nx">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapo"><span class="dcap">O</span></span>NCE upon a time there was a R&aacute;j&aacute; called Jabh&uacute;
R&aacute;j&aacute;, and he had a great many wives; at least he
had seven wives, but he had no children. Although
he had married seven wives, not one of them had given him a
child. At this he was greatly vexed and said, &ldquo;I have married
seven wives, and not one of them has given me a child.&rdquo;
And he got very angry with God: he said, &ldquo;Why does not
God give me any children? I will go into the jungle and
die by myself.&rdquo; The R&aacute;n&iacute;s coaxed him to stay, but he
wouldn&rsquo;t; he would go out into the jungle.</p>

<p>So he went out into the jungle very far, and God sent him
an old fak&iacute;r leaning on a stick. The R&aacute;j&aacute; met him, and the
fak&iacute;r said, &ldquo;Why do you come into the jungle? If you go
far into the jungle you will meet plenty of tigers, and they
will eat you. Tell me what you want. Whatever you want
I will give you.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute;. But
at last the R&aacute;j&aacute; told him, &ldquo;I have seven wives, and none of
them has given me any children, and so here I will die by
myself.&rdquo; Then the fak&iacute;r said, &ldquo;Take this stick, and a little
way off you will find a mango-tree with some mangoes on it.
Throw the stick at the mangoes with one hand, and catch
them as they fall with the other, and when you have caught
them all, take them home and give one to each of your seven
wives.&rdquo; So the R&aacute;j&aacute; went and knocked the mangoes off the
tree and caught them as the fak&iacute;r had told him. Then he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
looked about for the fak&iacute;r, but he could not find him, for
he had gone away into another part of the jungle. So he
went home and gave the seven mangoes to his wives. But
the fruit was so good that six of the wives ate it up, and
would not give the youngest wife any. She cried very much,
and went into the compound and picked up one of the mango
stones which one of the six wives had thrown away, and ate
it. By and by each of the six wives had a son; but the one
who had eaten the stone had a monkey, who was called in
consequence Bandars&aacute;b&aacute;s&aacute;, or Prince Monkey. He was really
a boy, but no one knew it, for he had a monkey-skin covering
him. His six brothers hated him. They went to school every
day; and the monkey went under the ground, and was taught
by the fairies. His mother did not know this; she thought,
as he was a monkey, he went to the jungle and swung in the
trees. He was the best and the cleverest of all the boys.</p>

<p>Now, in a kingdom a three months&rsquo; journey off by land
from Jabh&uacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s country, there lived a king called King
Jam&aacute;rs&aacute;. He had a very beautiful daughter whose name
was Princess Jah&uacute;ran, and as her father wanted a very strong
son-in-law, he had a large heavy iron ball made, and he sent
letters to all the R&aacute;j&aacute;s and R&aacute;j&aacute;s&rsquo; sons far and near to say that
whoever wished to marry his daughter, the Princess Jah&uacute;ran,
must be able to throw this heavy ball at her and hit her.
So many R&aacute;j&aacute;s went to try, but none of them could even
lift the ball. Now, one of these letters had come to Jabh&uacute;
R&aacute;j&aacute;, and his six elder sons determined they would go to
King Jam&aacute;rs&aacute;&rsquo;s country, for each of them was sure he could
throw the ball, and win the princess.</p>

<p>Prince Monkey laughed softly and said to himself, &ldquo;I will
go and try too. I know I shall succeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Off, therefore, the six brothers set on their long journey,
and the monkey followed them; but before he did so, he
went into the jungle and took off his monkey-skin, and God
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
sent him a beautiful horse and beautiful clothes. Then he
followed his brothers and overtook them, and gave them
betel-leaf and lovely flowers. &ldquo;What a beautiful boy!&rdquo;
they said. &ldquo;Who is it owns such a beautiful boy? He
must be some R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son.&rdquo; Then he galloped quickly away,
took off his grand clothes and put them on his horse, and
the horse rose into the air. He put on his monkey-skin and
followed his brothers.</p>

<p>When they reached King Jam&aacute;rs&aacute;&rsquo;s palace they pitched
their tents in his compound, which was very big. Every
evening the princess used to stand in her verandah and let
down her long golden hair so that it fell all round her, and
then the R&aacute;j&aacute;s who wished to marry her had to try to hit her
with the great heavy ball that lay on the ground just in front
of where she stood.</p>

<p>King Jam&aacute;rs&aacute;&rsquo;s house had more than one storey, and
you had to go upstairs to get to the Princess Jah&uacute;ran&rsquo;s
rooms which led into the verandah in which she used to
stand.</p>

<p>Well, Prince Monkey&rsquo;s six elder brothers all got ready to
go up to the palace and throw the ball. They were quite
sure they would throw it without any trouble. Before they
went they told their monkey brother to take care of their
tents, and to have a good dinner ready for them when they
returned. &ldquo;If the dinner is not ready, we will beat you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as they were gone, Prince Monkey took some
gold mohurs he had, and he went to a traveller&rsquo;s resting-house,
which was a little way outside King Jam&aacute;rs&aacute;&rsquo;s compound,
and gave them to the man who owned it, and bade
him give him a grand dinner for his six brothers. Then he
took the dinner to the tents, went into the jungle, and took
off his monkey-skin. And God sent him a grand horse from
heaven, and splendid clothes. These he put on, mounted
his horse, and rode to King Jam&aacute;rs&aacute;&rsquo;s compound. There he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
took no notice of either the king, or his daughter, or of the
ball, or of the R&aacute;j&aacute;s who were there to try and lift it. He
spoke only to his brothers, and gave them lovely flowers and
betel-leaf. Meanwhile, everybody was looking at him and
talking about him. &ldquo;Who can he be? Did you ever see
any one so lovely? Where does he come from? Just look
at his clothes! In our countries we cannot get any like
them!&rdquo; As for the Princess Jah&uacute;ran she thought to herself,
&ldquo;That R&aacute;j&aacute; shall be my husband, whether he lifts the ball
or not.&rdquo; When he had given his brothers the flowers and
betel-leaf, Prince Monkey rode straight to the jungle, took
off his clothes, laid them on his horse (which instantly went
up to heaven), put on his monkey-skin, went back to the
tents, and lay down to sleep.</p>

<p>When his brothers came home they were talking eagerly
about the unknown beautiful R&aacute;j&aacute;. All the time they were
eating their dinner they could speak of nothing else.</p>

<p>Well, every evening for about ten evenings it was just the
same story. Only every evening Prince Monkey appeared
in a different dress. The princess always thought, &ldquo;That is
the man I will marry, whether he can throw the ball or not.&rdquo;
Then about the eleventh evening, after he had given his
brothers the flowers and betel-leaf, he said to all the R&aacute;j&aacute;s
who were standing there, and to King Jam&aacute;rs&aacute; and to all
the servants, &ldquo;Now every one of you go and stand far away,
for I am going to throw the ball.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; they all cried,
&ldquo;we will stand here and see you.&rdquo; &ldquo;You must go far away.
You can look on at a distance,&rdquo; said the Monkey Prince;
&ldquo;the ball might fall back among you and hurt you.&rdquo; So
they all went off and stood round him at a distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Prince Monkey to himself, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hit the
princess this time; but I will hit the verandah railing.&rdquo;
Then he took up the ball with one hand, just as if it were
quite light, and threw it on the verandah railing, and then
he rode off fast to the jungle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
The next evening it was the same thing over again, only
this time he threw the ball into the Princess Jah&uacute;ran&rsquo;s clothes.</p>

<p>The next evening the ball fell on one of her feet, and
hurt her little toe-nail. Now, Princess Jah&uacute;ran was very
angry that this unknown beautiful prince should have thrown
the ball three times, and hit her twice, and hurt her the third
time, and yet had never spoken to her father, or let any one
know who he was, and had always, on the contrary, ridden
away as hard as he could, no one knew where. She was
very much in love with him, and was very anxious to find
this R&aacute;j&aacute; who had hit her twice, so she ordered a bow and
arrow to be brought to her, and said she would shoot the R&aacute;j&aacute;
the next time he hit her. She would not kill him; she would
only shoot the arrow at him. Well, the next evening Prince
Monkey threw the ball, and it fell on her other foot and hurt
her great toe-nail. When he saw she was hurt, he was very
sorry in his heart, and said, &ldquo;Did I hurt you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;very much.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, I am so sorry,&rdquo; said the prince.
&ldquo;I would not have thrown the ball so hard had I thought it
would hurt you.&rdquo; Then she shot the arrow, and hit him in
the leg, and a great deal of blood came out of the wound;
but he rode hard away to the jungle all the same, only this
time he did not take off his fine clothes, but he drew the
monkey-skin over them, and his horse went up to heaven,
and he went back to the tents. Then the princess sent a
servant into the town, and said, whoever or whatever he should
hear crying with pain, he should bring to her&mdash;were it a man,
or a jackal, or a dog, or a wild beast. So the servant went
round the town. The six brothers had gone to sleep, but
the poor monkey brother could not sleep, but sat up crying
from pain. He could not help it, do what he would, and
the servant, as he went round the town, heard him crying.
So he took him and brought him to the princess, and the
princess said she would marry him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried her father, &ldquo;marry that monkey? Never!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
Who ever heard of any one marrying a monkey, a nasty
monkey?&rdquo; But in spite of all the king said, the princess
declared marry that monkey she would. &ldquo;I like that monkey
very, very much,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will marry him. It is my
pleasure to marry him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute; at last, &ldquo;if
it is your pleasure to marry him, you must marry him; but
who ever heard of any one marrying a nasty monkey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they were married at once; and the Monkey Prince
wore his monkey-skin for a wedding garment.</p>

<p>That night when they went to bed, the young prince drew
off his skin and lay down by Jah&uacute;ran, and when she saw
her beautiful husband she was so glad, so glad. &ldquo;Why do
you wear a monkey-skin?&rdquo; she asked. He answered, &ldquo;I
wear it as a protection, because my brothers are naughty,
and would kill me if they knew what I really am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They lived very happily with King Jam&aacute;rs&aacute; for six months,
and the six elder brothers went on living there too, and hating
him more and more for having such a beautiful wife.</p>

<p>But one night Prince Monkey thought of his mother, and
he said to his wife, &ldquo;My mother perhaps is crying for me.
Let us go to my father&rsquo;s kingdom, and see her.&rdquo; Princess
Jah&uacute;ran agreed; so next morning they spoke to King
Jam&aacute;rs&aacute;, who said they might go.</p>

<p>The six brothers at once said, &ldquo;We will go with you;&rdquo;
and they also said, &ldquo;Let us get two big boats, one for you
and the princess, and one for ourselves, and let us go by
water, and not by land.&rdquo; Now by water it took only six
days to get to Jabh&uacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s kingdom, by land it took three
months. The Monkey Prince agreed to all his brothers
said.</p>

<p>Princess Jah&uacute;ran heard them planning to throw the monkey
into the water on the journey, and then to take her home
to their father as the wife of one of them; so as she was very
wise she went to her father and begged him to have six large
beautiful mattresses, well stuffed with cotton, made for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
&ldquo;What can you want with six mattresses?&rdquo; said the king.
&ldquo;I want my bed to be very comfortable on board the boat,&rdquo;
said his daughter. Her father loved her dearly, so he had
her mattresses made, beautiful mattresses and well stuffed
with cotton. The princess had them all carried to her
boat.</p>

<p>When everything was ready they went on board the boats
with the monkey&rsquo;s six brothers. Now, the princess had
warned her husband of his brothers&rsquo; wicked plans, and she
said to him, &ldquo;Never go near your brothers; never speak to
your brothers; for they want to kill you.&rdquo; The first day the
six brothers said to the monkey, &ldquo;Please bring us a little
salt.&rdquo; But the monkey said, &ldquo;No; my wife will take you
some.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the brothers, &ldquo;your wife cannot bring us
any. She is a princess. Do you bring us some.&rdquo; So they
threw a rope from one boat to another, and the monkey went
on the rope, and the brothers untied it, and the monkey fell
into the water. Then the princess cried out, &ldquo;My husband
will be drowned! My husband will be drowned!&rdquo; And
she threw out one of the mattresses; the monkey sat on it;
it floated back to his boat, and the crew drew him up.</p>

<p>The next day the six brothers begged Prince Monkey to
bring them water, and they threw a plank from their boat to
his for him to cross on. The prince set off with the water, in
spite of all his wife&rsquo;s entreaties, and his brothers tilted the
plank into the water. The prince would have been drowned
had not the Princess Jah&uacute;ran thrown him a mattress. And
the same thing happened during the next four days. The
brothers wanted something to eat or drink, and their monkey-brother
brought it them across a rope or plank, which they
cut or dropped into the water, and he would have died but
for the mattresses which his wife threw to him one by one.</p>

<p>When they reached Jabh&uacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s kingdom, the eldest son
went on shore up to his father&rsquo;s palace. Each of the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s
seven wives had a house to herself in his compound. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
went to his mother&rsquo;s house and said, &ldquo;Give me your palanquin,
mother, for I have brought home a most lovely wife,
and want to bring her to the palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this news his mother was delighted, and she told it to
the other R&aacute;n&iacute;s, and said, &ldquo;My son has brought home such
a lovely wife! I am so glad! oh, I am so glad!&rdquo; The
youngest R&aacute;n&iacute; began to cry bitterly. &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;is nothing but a monkey; he will never be married; he
will never have a wife at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the palanquin was got ready, and the seven R&aacute;n&iacute;s and
the prince went with it to the boat. The Princess Jah&uacute;ran came
on land with her monkey, and when the R&aacute;n&iacute;s saw her, they
all cried, &ldquo;How lovely she is! how beautiful!&rdquo; And the eldest
R&aacute;n&iacute; was gladder than ever, and the youngest cried still more.
The princess got into the palanquin with her monkey.
&ldquo;What are you doing with that horrid monkey?&rdquo; said the
eldest prince. &ldquo;Put him out of the palanquin directly.&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed
I will not,&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;He is my husband, and
I love him.&rdquo; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried all the R&aacute;n&iacute;s, &ldquo;are you married
to that monkey?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;Then get out
of my palanquin at once,&rdquo; said the eldest R&aacute;n&iacute;. &ldquo;You shall
not ride in my palanquin with that nasty monkey.&rdquo; The
youngest R&aacute;n&iacute; was very glad her son had such a beautiful wife.
So the princess got out, and took her monkey in her arms and
walked with him to the youngest R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s house, and there they
all lived for some time. Now the little R&aacute;n&iacute; did not know
her son was really a beautiful man, for the princess never
told her, as her husband had forbidden her to tell any one.</p>

<p>One evening Jabh&uacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s servants had a grand nautch in
the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s compound, and the R&aacute;j&aacute; and his sons and the
neighbouring R&aacute;j&aacute;s all came to see it. Prince Monkey said
to his wife, &ldquo;I, too, will go and see this nautch.&rdquo; So he took
off his monkey-skin, folded it up and laid it under her pillow.
Then he put on the clothes God had sent him from heaven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
the last time he threw the ball, and which he had not laid on
his horse&rsquo;s back when he put his monkey-skin on again, and
when he came among all the R&aacute;j&aacute;s and people who were
looking on at the nautch, they all exclaimed, &ldquo;Who is that?
Who can it be?&rdquo; He was very handsome, and he had beautiful
hair all gold. When he had stayed some time, Prince
Monkey went quickly back to his wife, and in the morning
he put on his monkey-skin again.</p>

<p>Now the little R&aacute;n&iacute;, his mother, though she was very
glad her monkey son had such a wife, could never understand
how it was that her daughter-in-law was so happy with
him. &ldquo;How could you marry him?&rdquo; she used to say to
her. &ldquo;Because it pleased me to marry him,&rdquo; the princess
used to answer. &ldquo;How can you be so happy with him?&rdquo;
said the mother. &ldquo;I love him,&rdquo; said the princess; and the
poor R&aacute;n&iacute; used to wonder at this more and more.</p>

<p>Well, one day there was another nautch, and Prince Monkey
went to it; but he left his skin under his wife&rsquo;s pillow.
As soon as he had gone, she called the little R&aacute;n&iacute;, and said,
&ldquo;See, you think my husband is a monkey; he is no monkey,
but a very handsome man. There is no one like him, he is
so beautiful.&rdquo; The R&aacute;n&iacute; did not believe her. Then the
princess took the skin from under her pillow. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;when your son puts this on, then he is a monkey;
when he takes it off he is a beautiful man. And now, I think
I will burn this skin, and then he must always be a man.
What do you say?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you sure it won&rsquo;t hurt him if you
burn his skin?&rdquo; said his mother. &ldquo;Perhaps he may die if it
is burnt.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no, he won&rsquo;t die,&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;Shall
I burn it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Burn it,&rdquo; said the little R&aacute;n&iacute;. Then the
princess threw the skin on the fire and burnt it quite up.</p>

<p>Prince Monkey was sitting looking on at the nautch when
suddenly his heart told him his wife had burnt his skin.
He jumped up directly and went home, and when he found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
his heart had told him true, he was so angry with his wife,
that he would say nothing to her but &ldquo;Why did you burn
my skin?&rdquo; and he was in such a rage that he went straight
to bed and went to sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning, while he slept, the princess went to the
little R&aacute;n&iacute;, and said, &ldquo;Come and see your beautiful son.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am ashamed to do so,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;n&iacute;. &ldquo;Ashamed to
look at your own son? What nonsense! Come directly,&rdquo;
said Princess Jah&uacute;ran. Then the little R&aacute;n&iacute; went with her,
and when she saw her beautiful son she was indeed glad,
and the prince opened his eyes and saw her, and then he
kissed her, and they were very happy.</p>

<p>The news spread through the compound, and Jabh&uacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;
and his sons and everybody came at once to see if it were
true. When they saw the beautiful young prince, with his
hair all gold, they could not stand, but fell down. Prince
Monkey lifted his father and loved him, and put his arms
round him, and said, &ldquo;I am your son, your own son; you
must not fall down before me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why did you wear that
monkey-skin?&rdquo; asked his father. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my
mother ate the mango stone instead of eating the mango,
and so I was born with this skin, and God ordered me to
wear it till I had found a wife.&rdquo; His brothers said, &ldquo;Who
could have guessed there was such a beautiful man inside
that monkey-skin? God&rsquo;s decrees are good!&rdquo; And they left
off hating their brother, Prince Monkey.</p>

<p>There were great rejoicings and feasts now, and all were
very happy. The six elder brothers lived always with their
father and Prince Monkey, but none of them ever married.</p>

BRAVE H&Iacute;R&Aacute;L&Aacute;LB&Aacute;S&Aacute;.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxi">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapo"><span class="dcap">O</span></span>NCE there was a R&aacute;j&aacute; called M&aacute;nikb&aacute;s&aacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;, or the
Ruby King, who had seven wives and seven children.
One day he told his wives he would go out
hunting, and he rode on and on, a long, long way from his
palace. A Rakshas was sitting by the wayside, who, seeing the
R&aacute;j&aacute; coming, quickly turned herself into a beautiful R&aacute;n&iacute;,
and sat there crying. The R&aacute;j&aacute; asked her, &ldquo;Why do you
cry?&rdquo; And the Rakshas answered, &ldquo;My husband has gone
away. He has been away many days, and I think he will
never come back again. If some R&aacute;j&aacute; will take me to his
house and marry me, I shall be very glad.&rdquo; So the R&aacute;j&aacute;
said, &ldquo;Will you come with me?&rdquo; And the Rakshas
answered, &ldquo;Very well, I will come.&rdquo; And then the R&aacute;j&aacute;
took the pretended R&aacute;n&iacute; home with him and married her.
He gave her a room to live in. Every night at twelve
o&rsquo;clock the Rakshas got up and devoured an elephant, or a
horse, or some other animal. The R&aacute;j&aacute; said, &ldquo;What can
become of my elephants and horses? Every day either an
elephant or a horse disappears. Who can take them away?&rdquo;
The Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute; said to him, &ldquo;Your seven R&aacute;n&iacute;s are
Rakshases, and every night at twelve o&rsquo;clock they devour a
horse, or an elephant, or some other creature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the R&aacute;j&aacute; believed her, and had a great hole dug just
outside his kingdom, into which he put the seven R&aacute;n&iacute;s with
their children, and then he sent a sepoy to them and bade
him take out all the R&aacute;n&iacute;s&rsquo; eyes, and bring them to him. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
the sepoy did. After a time the poor R&aacute;n&iacute;s grew so hungry
that six of them ate their children, but the seventh R&aacute;n&iacute;, who
was the youngest of them all, declared she would never eat
her child though she might die of hunger, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
love him a great deal too much.&rdquo; God was very pleased with
the seventh R&aacute;n&iacute; for this, and so every day he sent her a little
food, which she divided with the other R&aacute;n&iacute;s. And every
day her little boy grew bigger, and bigger, and bigger, until
he had become a strong lad, when, as he thought it was very
dark in the hole, he climbed out of it and looked all about.
Then he came back to his mothers (for he called all the
seven R&aacute;n&iacute;s &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; now), who told him he was not to
clamber up out of the hole any more, for if he did, some
one might kill him. &ldquo;Still, if you will go,&rdquo; they added,
&ldquo;do not go to your father&rsquo;s kingdom, but stay near this
place.&rdquo; The boy said, &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and every day he climbed
out of the hole and only went where his seven mothers told
him he might go, and he used to beg the people about to
give him a little rice, and flour and bread, which they did.</p>

<p>One day he said to his mothers, &ldquo;If you let me go now to
my father&rsquo;s kingdom, I will go.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, you may go,&rdquo; they
said; &ldquo;but come back again soon.&rdquo; This he promised to do,
and he went to his father&rsquo;s kingdom. For some time he stood
daily at the door of his father&rsquo;s palace and then returned to
the hole. One day the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute; was standing in the
verandah, and she thought, &ldquo;I am sure that is the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s
son.&rdquo; The servants every day asked the boy, &ldquo;Why do you
always stand at the door of the palace?&rdquo; &ldquo;I want service
with the R&aacute;j&aacute;,&rdquo; he would reply. &ldquo;If the R&aacute;j&aacute; has any place
he can give me, I will take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute; said to the R&aacute;j&aacute;, &ldquo;The boy standing
out there wants service. May I take him into mine?&rdquo;
The R&aacute;j&aacute; answered, &ldquo;Very well, send for him.&rdquo; So all the
servants ran and fetched the boy. The Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute; asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
him, &ldquo;Are you willing to do anything I tell you?&rdquo; The
boy said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then you shall be my servant,&rdquo; she
said, and first she told him he must go to the Rakshas
country to fetch some rose-water for her. &ldquo;I will give you
a letter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;so that no harm may happen to you.&rdquo;
The lad answered, &ldquo;Very well, only you must give me three
shields full of money.&rdquo; She gave him the three shields full
of money, and he took them and went home to his mothers.
Then he got two servants for them, one to take care of them,
and one to go to the bazar. His mothers gave him food for
the journey, and he left them the remainder of his money,
telling them to take great care of it. He then returned to
the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute; for his letter. She told the R&aacute;j&aacute; she was
feeling ill, and would not be quite well until she got some
rose-water from the Rakshas country. The R&aacute;j&aacute; said, &ldquo;Then
you had better send this boy for it.&rdquo; So she gave him a letter,
in which she had written, &ldquo;When this boy arrives among
you, kill him and eat him instantly,&rdquo; and he set out at once.</p>

<p>He went on and on till he came to a great river in which
lived a huge water-snake. When the water-snake saw him
it began to weep very much, and cried out to the boy, &ldquo;If
you go to the Rakshas country you will be eaten up.&rdquo; The
lad, whose name was H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;lb&aacute;s&aacute;, said, &ldquo;I cannot help it;
I am the R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s servant, so I must do what she tells me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the water-snake, &ldquo;get on my back, and I will
take you across this river.&rdquo; So he got on the water-snake&rsquo;s
back, and it took him over the river. Then H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;lb&aacute;s&aacute;
went on and on until he came to a house in which a Rakshas
lived. A R&aacute;n&iacute; lived there too that the Rakshas had carried
off from her father and mother when she was a little girl.
She was playing in her father the Sondarb&aacute;s&aacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s garden,
which was full of delicious fruits, which the Rakshas came
to eat, and when he saw Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; he seized her in his
mouth and ran off with her. Only she was so beautiful he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
could never find it in his heart to eat her, but brought her up
as his own child. Her name was Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;, that is, the
Golden R&aacute;n&iacute;, because her teeth and her hair were made of
gold. Now the Rakshas who had carried her off, and whom
she called Papa, had a great thick stick, and when he laid
this stick at her feet she could not stir, but when he laid it
at her head, she could move again.</p>

<p>When the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son came up, Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; was lying on
her bed with the thick stick at her feet, and as soon as she
saw the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son she began to cry very much. &ldquo;Oh, why
have you come here? You will surely be killed,&rdquo; she said. The
R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son answered, &ldquo;I cannot help that. I am the R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s
servant, so I must do what she tells me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said
Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;; &ldquo;but put this stick at my head, and then I
shall be able to move.&rdquo; The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son laid the stick at her
head, and she got up and gave him some food, and then
asked him if he had a letter. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Let
me see it,&rdquo; said the Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;. So he gave her the letter,
and when she had read it she cried, &ldquo;Oh, this is a very
wicked letter. It will bring you no good; for if the Rakshases
see it, they will kill you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;lb&aacute;s&aacute;.
And the Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; tore up the letter and wrote another
in which she said, &ldquo;Make much of this boy. Send him
home quickly, and give him a jug of rose-water to bring back
with him, and see that he gets no hurt.&rdquo; Then the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s
son set out again for the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s house.
He had not gone very far when he met a very big Rakshas,
and he cried out to him, &ldquo;Uncle.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is this boy,&rdquo; said
the Rakshas, &ldquo;who calls me uncle?&rdquo; And he was just going to
kill him when H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;lb&aacute;s&aacute; showed his letter, and the Rakshas
let him pass on. He went a little further until he met another
Rakshas, bigger than the first, and the Rakshas screamed
at him and was just going to fall on him and kill him,
but the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son showed the letter, and the Rakshas let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
him pass unhurt. When H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;lb&aacute;s&aacute; came to the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s
mother he showed her the letter, and she gave
him the rose-water at once and sent him off. All the Rakshases
were very good to him, and some carried him part of
the way home. When he came to Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s house she
was lying on her bed with the stick at her feet, and as soon
as she saw H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;lb&aacute;s&aacute; she laughed and said, &ldquo;Oh, you have
come back again? Put this stick at my head.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said
the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come back again, but I was dreadfully
frightened very often.&rdquo; Then he put the stick at her head,
and she gave him some food to eat. After he had eaten it
he went on again, and when he came to the river the water-snake
carried him across to the other side, and he travelled
to his father&rsquo;s kingdom. There he went to the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute;
and gave her the rose-water. She was very angry at
seeing him, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure my father and my mother,
my brothers and my sisters, don&rsquo;t love me one bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she said to H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;lb&aacute;s&aacute;, &ldquo;You must go to-morrow to
the Rakshas kingdom to fetch me flowers.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo;
said H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l, &ldquo;but this time I must have four shields full of
rupees.&rdquo; The Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute; gave him the four shields full
of rupees; and the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son went to his mother&rsquo;s hole and
bought a quantity of food for them, enough to last them all
the time he should be away, and he hired two servants for
them, and said good-bye to his seven mothers and returned
to M&aacute;nikb&aacute;s&aacute;&rsquo;s palace for his letter. This the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute;
gave him, and in it she wrote, &ldquo;Kill him and eat him at once.
If you do not, and you send him back to me, I will never
see your faces again.&rdquo; H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l took his letters and went on
his way. When he reached the river the water-snake took
him across to the other side, and he walked on till he came
to Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s house. She was lying on the bed with
the stick at her feet. &ldquo;Oh, why have you come here again?&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;How can I help coming?&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
&ldquo;I must do what my mistress bids me.&rdquo; &ldquo;So you must,&rdquo;
said the Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;; &ldquo;but put this stick at my head.&rdquo;
This he did, and she got up and gave him food, and asked
him to let her see his letter, and when she had read it she
cried, &ldquo;This is a very wicked letter. If you take it with you,
you will surely die.&rdquo; Then she tore up the letter and burnt
it, and wrote another in which she said, &ldquo;You must all be
very good to this boy. Show him all the gardens and see
that he is not hurt in any way.&rdquo; She gave it to H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l, and
he begged her to ask the Rakshas, her father, where he kept
his soul. Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; promised she would. She then
turned H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l into a little fly, and put him into a tiny box,
and put the box under her pillow. When the Rakshas came
home he began sniffing about and said, &ldquo;Surely there is a
man here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;; &ldquo;no one is here
but me.&rdquo; The Rakshas was satisfied. When Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;
and her father were in bed she asked, &ldquo;Papa, where is your
soul?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why do you want to know?&rdquo; said the Rakshas. &ldquo;I
will tell you another day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day at nine in the morning the Rakshas went
away, and Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; took H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l and restored him to his
human shape, and gave him some food, and he travelled on
till he reached the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s mother, whom he called
Grannie. She welcomed him very kindly and showed him
the garden, which was very large. The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son noticed
a number of jugs and water-jars. So he said, &ldquo;Grannie,
what is there in all these jars and jugs?&rdquo; She answered,
showing them to him one by one, &ldquo;In this is such and such
a thing,&rdquo; and so on, telling him the contents of each,
till she came to the water-jar in which were his mothers&rsquo;
eyes. &ldquo;In this jar,&rdquo; said the Rakshas, &ldquo;are your seven
mothers&rsquo; eyes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, grannie dear!&rdquo; said H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l, &ldquo;give
me my mothers&rsquo; eyes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, dear boy,&rdquo; said the
old Rakshas, &ldquo;you shall have them.&rdquo; She gave him, too,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
some ointment, and told him to rub the eyes with it when
he put them into his mothers&rsquo; heads, and that then they
would see quite well; and he took the eyes and tied them
up in a corner of his cloth. His grannie gave him the
flowers, and he went back to Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;. She was lying
on her bed with the stick at her feet, and when she saw
him she laughed and said, &ldquo;Oh, so you have come back
again?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; said H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l; &ldquo;and I have got
the flowers, and my seven mothers&rsquo; eyes too.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you
indeed?&rdquo; said Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;. &ldquo;Put this stick at my head.&rdquo;
He did so, and she got up and gave him some food, and he
told her to ask her father the Rakshas where his soul was.
She promised she would, and she changed him into a little
fly, and shut him up in a tiny box, and put the tiny box
under her pillow. By and by home came the Rakshas, and
began to sniff about crying, &ldquo;A man is here!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo;
said Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;; and she gave him some dinner, and when
they were in bed she asked him, &ldquo;Papa, where is your soul?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you another day,&rdquo; said the Rakshas. The next day,
when he had gone out to find food, Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; took the
little fly, H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l, and restored him to his human shape, and
gave him some food and sent him on his way. When he
reached the river, the water-snake took him over to the other
side, and he journeyed on till he came to his father&rsquo;s kingdom.
First he went to his mothers&rsquo; hole and gave them their
fourteen eyes, and he put them into their heads with the
ointment which the Rakshas-grannie had given him. Then
he went to M&aacute;nikb&aacute;s&aacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s palace, and when the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute;
saw him she was furious. &ldquo;I am sure my father and
my mother, my sisters and my brothers, do not love me one
bit. I will never see their faces again. But I&rsquo;ll send him to
them once more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is what she thought, but she took the flowers and
said, &ldquo;You must go a third time to the Rakshas country.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the boy: &ldquo;only I&rsquo;ll not go till the fourth day
from to-day, for I am very tired. And you must give me
four shields full of rupees.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute;.
&ldquo;This time you must get me a s&aacute;r&iacute;.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And she gave
him the four shields full of money. Then he went to his
mothers, and bought them a house and got food for them,
and stayed with them four days.</p>

<p>At the end of the four days he went to the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute;,
who gave him a letter in which she had written, &ldquo;If you do
not kill and eat this boy as soon as he arrives, I will never
see your faces again.&rdquo; The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son took the letter and
set out on his journey.</p>

<p>When he came to the river, the water-snake took him
across; and when he arrived at Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s house, there
she was lying on her bed with the thick stick at her feet. She
said, &ldquo;Oh, you have come here again, have you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I have come for the last time.&rdquo; &ldquo;Put the stick at
my head,&rdquo; said she. So he laid the stick at her head. Then
she gave him some food, and just before the Rakshas came
home, he bade her ask him where he kept his soul. When
she saw him coming, Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; turned H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;lb&aacute;s&aacute; into a
little fly, put him in a tiny box, and put the box under her
pillow. As soon as she and the Rakshas had gone to bed,
she asked him, &ldquo;Papa, where do you keep your soul?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sixteen miles away from this place,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is a tree.
Round the tree are tigers, and bears, and scorpions, and
snakes; on the top of the tree is a very great fat snake; on
his head is a little cage; in the cage is a bird; and my soul is
in that bird.&rdquo; The little fly listened all the time. The next
morning, when the Rakshas had gone, Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; took the
fly and gave him back his human form, gave him some food,
and then asked to see his letter. When she had read it she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
screamed and said, &ldquo;Oh! if you go with this letter you will
surely die.&rdquo; So she tore it up into little bits and threw it into
the fire. And she wrote another in which she said, &ldquo;Make
a great deal of this boy; see that he gets no hurt; give him
the s&aacute;r&iacute; for me; show him the garden; and be very kind to
him.&rdquo; She then gave H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l the letter, and he journeyed
on in safety till he reached his Rakshas-grannie&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>The Rakshas-grannie was very good to him; showed him
the garden, and gave him the s&aacute;r&iacute;; and he then said his
mother, the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute;, was in great trouble about her
soul, and wanted very much to have it. So the Rakshas-grannie
gave him a bird in which was the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s
soul, charging him to take the greatest care of it. Then he
said, &ldquo;My mother, the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute;, also wants a stone
such that, if you lay it on the ground, or if you put it in your
clothes, it will become gold, and also your long heavy gold
necklace that hangs down to the waist.&rdquo; Both these things the
Rakshas-grannie gave to H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l. Then he returned to Sonahr&iacute;
R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s house, where he found her lying on her bed with the
thick stick at her feet. &ldquo;Oh, there you are,&rdquo; said Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;,
laughing. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have come.&rdquo; And he put the
stick at her head, and she got up and gave him some food.</p>

<p>He told her he was going to fetch her Rakshas-father&rsquo;s
soul, but that he did not quite know how to pass through the
tigers and bears, and scorpions and snakes, that guarded it.
So she gave him a feather, and said, &ldquo;As long as you hold this
feather straight, you can come to no harm, for you will be
invisible. You will see everything, but nothing will see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He carried the feather straight as she had bidden him and
reached the tree in safety. Then he climbed up it, took the
little cage, and came down again. Though the Rakshas
was far off, he knew at once something had happened to his
bird. H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l pulled off the bird&rsquo;s right leg, and the Rakshas&rsquo;
right leg fell off, but on he hopped on one leg. Then the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son pulled off the bird&rsquo;s left leg, and off fell the
Rakshas&rsquo; left leg, but still he went on towards his house on
his hands. Then H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l pulled off the bird&rsquo;s wings, and the
Rakshas&rsquo; two arms fell off. And then, just as the Rakshas
reached the door of his house, H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l wrung the bird&rsquo;s neck,
and the Rakshas fell dead. Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; was greatly frightened
when she heard such a heavy thing fall thump on the
ground so close to the house, but she could not move, for
the thick stick lay at her feet. H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l ran as fast as he could
to Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;. When he arrived at the door of her house
he saw the Rakshas lying dead, and he went in and told
Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; that her Rakshas-father was killed. &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l; &ldquo;come and
see.&rdquo; So he put the stick at her head. &ldquo;I am sure you are
telling a lie,&rdquo; said Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;. &ldquo;I should be very glad if
he were dead, for I do not like living with him, I am so
afraid of him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed he&rsquo;s dead. Do come and see,&rdquo;
said H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l. Then they went outside, and when Sonahr&iacute;
R&aacute;n&iacute; saw her Rakshas-father lying there dead, she was
exceedingly happy, and said to H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l, &ldquo;I will go home
with you, and be your wife.&rdquo; So they were married, and
then they went into Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s Rakshas-father&rsquo;s house
and took all the money and jewels they could find. And
H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l gave the s&aacute;r&iacute;, the stone, and the necklace to Sonahr&iacute;
R&aacute;n&iacute;, and he took some flowers for the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute;.</p>

<p>When they came to the river, the water-snake carried them
across to the other side, and they travelled on till they came
to M&aacute;nikb&aacute;s&aacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s kingdom. There H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l went first of
all to his mothers, and when they saw Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; they
wondered who the beautiful woman could be that their son
had brought home. He said to them, &ldquo;This is Sonahr&iacute;
R&aacute;n&iacute;, my wife. But for her I should have died.&rdquo; Then he
bought a grand house for Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; and his seven mothers
to live in, and he got four servants for Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;, two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
to cook, and two to wait on her. The seven mothers and
Sonahr&iacute; used all to sit on a beautiful, clean quilted cushion,
as big as a carpet, Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; in the middle and the seven
mothers round her, while they sewed, or wrote, and talked.
H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l then went to the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute; and said, &ldquo;I could
not get the s&aacute;r&iacute; you sent me for, so I brought you these
flowers instead.&rdquo; When she saw the flowers she was frantic.
She said, &ldquo;My father, my mother, my sisters, my brothers,
don&rsquo;t care for me, not one bit! not one scrap! I will never
see their faces again&mdash;never! never! I will send some
other messenger to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son came to M&aacute;nikb&aacute;s&aacute; and said,
&ldquo;Would you like to see a grand sight?&rdquo; M&aacute;nikb&aacute;s&aacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;
said, &ldquo;What sight?&rdquo; H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l said, &ldquo;If you would like to see
a really grand sight you must do what I tell you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo;
answered M&aacute;nikb&aacute;s&aacute;, &ldquo;I will do whatever you tell me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said his son, &ldquo;you must build a very strong
iron house, and round it you must lay heaps of wood. In that
house you must put your present R&aacute;n&iacute;.&rdquo; So M&aacute;nikb&aacute;s&aacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;
had a very strong iron house built, round which he set walls
of wood. Then he went to his Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute; and said,
&ldquo;Will you go inside that iron house, and see what it is like?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; answered she. The R&aacute;j&aacute; had had great venetians
made for the house, and only one door. As soon as
the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute; had gone in, he locked the door. Then
H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l took the little bird, a cockatoo, in which was the
Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s soul, and showed it to the Rakshas-R&aacute;n&iacute;
from afar off. When she saw it she turned herself into a
huge Rakshas as big as a house. She could not turn in the
iron house because she was so huge. M&aacute;nikb&aacute;s&aacute; was dreadfully
frightened when he saw his R&aacute;n&iacute; was a horrible Rakshas.
Then H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l pulled off the bird&rsquo;s legs, and as the
Rakshas was breaking through the iron house to seize
H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l, he wrung the cockatoo&rsquo;s neck, and the Rakshas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
died instantly. They set fire to the walls of wood, and the
body of the wicked Rakshas was burnt to fine ashes.</p>

<p>The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s Waz&iacute;r turned to the R&aacute;j&aacute; and said, &ldquo;What a
fool you were to marry this Rakshas, and at her bidding to
send your seven wives and your seven sons away into the
jungle, taking out your seven wives&rsquo; eyes, and being altogether
so cruel to them! You are a great, great fool!&rdquo; The
poor R&aacute;j&aacute; wept, and then the Waz&iacute;r, pointing to H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l,
said, &ldquo;This is your seventh and youngest R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s son.&rdquo; The
R&aacute;j&aacute; then embraced H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;lb&aacute;s&aacute; and asked his forgiveness.
And H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l told him his story, how he and his mothers had
lived a long, long time in the hole; how six of the R&aacute;n&iacute;s
had eaten their children; how his mother had not had the
heart to eat him; how he had got his seven mothers&rsquo; eyes
from the Rakshas-grannie; and lastly, how he had married
Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;. Then the R&aacute;j&aacute; ordered seven litters for his
seven R&aacute;n&iacute;s, and a beautiful litter with rich cloth for Sonahr&iacute;
R&aacute;n&iacute;. The R&aacute;j&aacute; and his Waz&iacute;r and his attendants, and his
son, all went with the litters to H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l&rsquo;s house; and when the
R&aacute;j&aacute; saw Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; he fell flat on his face, he was so struck
by her beauty. For she had a fair, fair skin, rosy cheeks, blue
eyes, rosy lips, golden eyelashes, and golden eyebrows, and
golden hair. When she combed her hair, she used to put the
hair she combed out in paper and to lay the paper on the river,
and it floated down to where the poor people caught it, and
sold it, and got heaps of money for it. Her s&aacute;r&iacute; was of gold,
her shoes were of gold, for God loved her dearly. Then the
R&aacute;j&aacute; rose and embraced all his wives and Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;, and
the seven R&aacute;n&iacute;s walked into the seven litters; but Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;
was carried to hers, for fear she should soil her feet, or get
hurt. Then M&aacute;nikb&aacute;s&aacute; R&aacute;j&aacute; gave H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l&rsquo;s house to his Waz&iacute;r,
while his seven R&aacute;n&iacute;s and H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l and Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; lived
with him in his palace. And they lived happily for ever after.</p>

THE MAN WHO WENT TO SEEK HIS FATE.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxii">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapo"><span class="dcap">O</span></span>NCE there was a very poor man who had a wife and
twelve children, and not a single rupee. The poor
children used to cry with hunger, and the man and
his wife did not know what to do. At last he got furious with
God and said, &ldquo;How wicked God is! He gives me a great
many children, but no money.&rdquo; So he set out to find his fate.
In the jungle he met a camel with two heavy sacks of gold on
its back. This camel belonged to a R&aacute;j&aacute;, and once it was
travelling with other camels and with the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s servants to
another country, and carrying the sacks of gold. Every
night they encamped and started again early in the morning;
but one morning the servants forgot to take this camel with
them, and the camel forgot the road home, and the sacks
were too tightly strapped for it to get rid of them. So it
wandered about the jungle with the sacks on its back for
twelve years. The camel asked the poor man where he was
going. &ldquo;I am going to seek my fate, to ask it why I am so
poor,&rdquo; he answered. The camel said, &ldquo;Ask it, too, why for
twelve years I have had to carry these two sacks of gold.
All this time I have not been able to lie down, or to eat,
or to drink.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the man, and he went on.</p>

<p>Then he came to a river in which he saw an alligator.
The alligator took him across, and when he got to the other
side it asked him where he was going. The man said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am going to seek my fate, to ask it why I am so poor.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the alligator, &ldquo;ask it also why for twelve years
I have a great burning in my stomach.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the
man.</p>

<p>Then he went on and on till he came to a tiger, who was
lying on the ground with a great thorn sticking in his foot.
This tiger had gone out one day to hunt for food, and not
looking where he was going, he put his foot on the thorn,
and the thorn ran into his foot. And so God grew very
angry and said, &ldquo;Because you are such a careless, stupid
fellow, and don&rsquo;t look where you are going, for twelve years
this thorn shall remain in your foot.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where are you
going?&rdquo; the tiger asked the man. &ldquo;I am going to seek my
fate, to ask it why I am so poor. Some one told me that my
fate was far, far away, a twelve years&rsquo; journey from my own
country, and that it was lying down, and that I must take a
thick stick and beat it with all my might.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ask it, too,&rdquo;
said the tiger, &ldquo;why for twelve years I have had this thorn in
my foot and cannot get it out, though I have tried hard to
do so.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>Then he came to the place where every one&rsquo;s fate lives.
The fates are stones, some standing and others lying on the
ground. &ldquo;This must be mine,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it is lying on the
ground, that&rsquo;s why I am so poor.&rdquo; So he took the thick
stick he had in his hand, and beat it, and beat it, and beat
it, but still it would not stir. As night was approaching he
left off beating it, and God sent a soul into the poor man&rsquo;s
fate, and it became a man, who stood looking at the poor
man and said, &ldquo;Why have you beaten me so much?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Because you were lying down, and I am very poor, and
at home my wife and my children are starving.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, things
will go well with you now,&rdquo; said the fate, and the man was
satisfied. He said to his fate, &ldquo;While coming here I met a
camel who for twelve years has had to wander about with two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
heavy sacks of gold on its back, and it wants to know why it
must carry them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the fate, &ldquo;just take the sacks
off its back and then it will be free.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the poor
man. &ldquo;Then I met an alligator who for twelve years has
had a great burning in its stomach.&rdquo; The fate said, &ldquo;In its
stomach is a very large ruby, as big as your hand. If the
alligator will only throw up the ruby, it will be quite well.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Next I met a tiger who has had for twelve years a great
thorn in his foot which he cannot take out.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pull it out
with your teeth,&rdquo; said the fate; and then God withdrew the
soul, and the fate became a stone again which stood up on
the ground.</p>

<p>Then the man set out on his journey home, and he came to
the tiger. &ldquo;What did your fate say?&rdquo; said the tiger. &ldquo;Give
me your foot and I will take out the thorn,&rdquo; said the poor
man. The tiger stretched out the foot with the thorn in it,
and the man pulled out the thorn with his teeth. It was a
very large thorn, as big as the man&rsquo;s hand. The tiger felt
grateful to the poor man, and as he was very rich, for he
had eaten a great many R&aacute;j&aacute;s and people, and had all their
money, he said to the man, &ldquo;I will give you some gold in
return for your kindness.&rdquo; &ldquo;You have no money,&rdquo; said the
man. &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said the tiger, and he went into his den, and
the poor man followed. &ldquo;Give me your cloth,&rdquo; said the tiger.
The man laid it on the ground. Then the tiger took quantities
of gold and jewels and filled the cloth with them.
And the poor man took up his cloth, thanked the tiger,
and went his way. Then he met the alligator who took
him across the river. The alligator said, &ldquo;Did you ask
your fate why there is such burning in my stomach?&rdquo; &ldquo;I
did,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;It is because you have a very large
ruby in your stomach. If you will only throw it up, you will
be quite well.&rdquo; Then the alligator threw the ruby up out of
its mouth, and that very instant the burning in its stomach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
ceased. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the alligator, looking at the ruby, &ldquo;I
swallowed that one day when I was drinking.&rdquo; And he gave
the ruby to the man, saying, &ldquo;In return for your kindness I
will give you this ruby. It is a very precious stone.&rdquo; (In
old days every R&aacute;j&aacute; possessed such a ruby; now very few
R&aacute;j&aacute;s, if any, have one.) The poor man thanked the alligator,
put the ruby into his cloth, and went on his way till he
came to the camel, who said, &ldquo;Did you ask your fate why
I have to carry these two sacks of gold?&rdquo; &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said the
man, and he took the sacks off the camel&rsquo;s back. How happy
and grateful the camel felt! &ldquo;How kind of you,&rdquo; he said
to the man, &ldquo;to take the sacks off. Now I can eat, now I
can drink, and now I can lie down. Because you have been
so kind to me, I give you the two sacks of gold, and I will
carry them and your bundle home to your house for you,
and then I will come back and live here in the jungle.&rdquo;
Then the poor man put the two sacks of gold and his bundle
on the camel, who carried them to his house. When he got
there, he took the sacks and his bundle off the camel, who
thanked him again for his kindness and went back to his
jungle, feeling very glad at having got rid of his heavy burthen.</p>

<p>When the poor man&rsquo;s wife and children saw the gold and
jewels and the ruby, they cried, &ldquo;Where did you get these?&rdquo;
And the man told them his whole story. And he bought
food for his wife and children, and gave them a beautiful
house, and got them clothes, for now he was very rich.</p>

<p>Another poor man who was not quite, but nearly, as poor
as this man had been, asked him where he had got his riches.
&ldquo;I got them out of a river,&rdquo; answered the man. &ldquo;I drew
the water with a bucket, and in every bucketful there was
gold.&rdquo; The other man started off to the river and began
drawing up water in a bucket. &ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo; cried an alligator,
who was the king of the fishes; &ldquo;you are taking all the
water out of the river and my fishes will die.&rdquo; &ldquo;I want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
money,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;and I can find none, so I am taking
the water out of the river in order to get some.&rdquo; &ldquo;You
shall have some in a minute,&rdquo; said the alligator, &ldquo;only do
stop drawing the water.&rdquo; Then a great wave of water dashed
on to the land and dashed back into the river, leaving behind
it a great heap of gold, which the man picked up joyfully.
The next day he came again, and night and day he
drew water out of the river. At last the alligator got very
angry, and said, &ldquo;My fishes will all die for want of water.
Once I gave the man a heap of gold, and yet he wants more.
I won&rsquo;t give him any,&rdquo; and the alligator thrust up his head
out of the river, and swallowed the man whole. For four
days and four nights the man lived in the alligator&rsquo;s stomach.
At the end of the fourth night the king of the fishes said to
him, &ldquo;I will let you get out of my stomach on condition
that you tell no man what has happened to you. If you do,
you will die instantly.&rdquo; The man jumped out of the alligator&rsquo;s
mouth and walked towards his house. On his way
he met some men and told them what had happened to him,
and as soon as he got home he told his wife and children,
and the moment he had done so he became mad and dumb
and blood came out of his mouth, and he fell down dead.</p>

THE UPRIGHT KING.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxiii">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapt"><span class="dcap">T</span></span>HERE was a great Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; whose name was Harchand
R&aacute;j&aacute;, and he had an only son called M&aacute;nikchand.
He was very rich and had a great deal of
money, and he also had a very large garden full of lovely
flowers and fruits which he prized greatly. Every morning
before he bathed he used to give some poor fak&iacute;r two pounds
and a half of gold. Now Harchand Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; used to pray
a great deal to God, and God was very fond of him, so he
said one day, &ldquo;To see if Harchand Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; really loves me,
I will make him very poor for twelve years.&rdquo; And at night
God came down in the shape of a great boar, and ate up
everything that was in Harchand Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s garden. The
boar then ran away into the jungle. Next morning the gardener
got up and looked out into the garden, and what was
his astonishment when he saw it was all spoilt. Nothing was
left in it; it was not a garden any more. He went quickly
to the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; and said, &ldquo;Oh, master! oh, Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;! your
garden is quite spoilt. Last night a boar came and ate
up everything in it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;, who
would not believe him. &ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; said the gardener;
&ldquo;you can come and see for yourself.&rdquo; So the R&aacute;j&aacute;
got up at once and put on his clothes, and went into
the garden, and found it all empty. He went back to
the house very melancholy. Then as usual he gave a fak&iacute;r
his two pounds and a half of gold. After breakfast he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
went out hunting. The boar which had run away into
the wood changed himself into a very old fak&iacute;r, who shook
from old age. As Harchand Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; passed, the old fak&iacute;r
held out his hand, saying, &ldquo;Please give me a few pice, I
am so poor and hungry.&rdquo; The Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; said, &ldquo;Come to
my palace and I will give you two pounds and a half of
gold.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the fak&iacute;r, &ldquo;surely you would never
give me so much as that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; said the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;.
&ldquo;Every morning before I bathe I give a fak&iacute;r two pounds and
a half of gold.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said the fak&iacute;r, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
give away your money in that way.&rdquo; &ldquo;Really, I do,&rdquo; said
the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;, &ldquo;and I promise to give you two pounds and
a half of gold.&rdquo; So the fak&iacute;r followed Harchand Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;
home, and when they reached the palace, the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; told
his treasurer to give the old fak&iacute;r two pounds and a half
of gold. The treasurer went into the treasury, but all the
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s gold and silver and jewels had become charcoal!
The treasurer came out again to the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; saying, &ldquo;Oh,
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;, all your gold and silver and jewels are turned
into charcoal!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; said the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;. &ldquo;Come
and see, Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;,&rdquo; said the treasurer, who was in a great
fright. The Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; went into his treasury, and was quite
sad at the sight of the charcoal. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;God
has made me very poor, but still I must give this fak&iacute;r his
money.&rdquo; So he went to the fak&iacute;r and said, &ldquo;All my gold
and silver and jewels are turned into charcoal; but I will
sell my wife, and my boy, and myself, and then I will give
you the money I promised you.&rdquo; And he went and fetched
his wife and son, and left his palace, his houses, servants,
and possessions.</p>

<p>He then went to a merchant, who bought from him his
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute;, who was called H&iacute;r&aacute;l&iacute;, that is, the diamond lady,
for she was very beautiful, and her face shone like a diamond.
Her hands were very small, and so were her feet. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
merchant gave the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; a pound of gold for the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute;.
Next, Harchand Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; went to a cowherd and sold him his
son M&aacute;nikchand. The cowherd gave him for the boy half a
pound of gold. Then he went to a dom, that is, a man of a
very low caste, who kept a tank into which it was his business
to throw the bodies of those who died. If it was a dead man or
woman, the dom took one rupee, if it was a dead child he was
only paid eight annas. To this dom Harchand sold himself for
a pound of gold, and he gave the two pounds and a half of gold
to the fak&iacute;r, who then went home. The dom said, &ldquo;Will
you stay by the tank for a few days while I go home and do
my other work, which is weaving baskets? If any one brings
you a dead body you must throw it into the water. If it
is the body of a man or woman, take one rupee in payment;
if it is a dead child, take eight annas; and if the bearers have
got no money, take a bit of cloth. Don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo; And the
dom went away, leaving Harchand sitting by the tank.</p>

<p>Well, Harchand Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; sat for some days by the tank,
and when any one brought him dead bodies he threw them
into it. For a dead man or woman he took one rupee, for
a dead child eight annas, and if the bearers had no money
to give him, he took some cloth. Some time had passed, and
M&aacute;nikchand, the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son, died; so H&iacute;r&aacute;l&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; went
to the cowherd to ask him for her dead child. The cowherd
gave him to her, and she took him to the tank. Harchand
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; was sitting by the tank, and when H&iacute;r&aacute;l&iacute; Mah&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute;
saw him she said, &ldquo;I know that man is my husband, so he
will not take any money for throwing his child into the water.&rdquo;
So she went up to him and said, &ldquo;Will you throw this child
into the tank for me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; said Harchand Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;;
&ldquo;only first give me eight annas.&rdquo; &ldquo;You surely won&rsquo;t
take any money for throwing your own son into the tank?&rdquo;
said the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute;. &ldquo;You must pay me,&rdquo; said Harchand
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;, &ldquo;for I must obey the dom&rsquo;s orders. If you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
no money, give me a piece of cloth.&rdquo; So the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute;
tore off a great piece of her s&aacute;r&iacute; and gave it him, and the
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; took his son and threw him into the tank. As he
threw him in he cried out to the king of the fishes, who was
an alligator, &ldquo;Take great care of this body.&rdquo; The king of
fishes said, &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; Then the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute; went back to
the merchant.</p>

<p>And the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; caught a fish, and cooked it, and laid
it by the tank, saying, &ldquo;I will go and bathe and then I will
eat it.&rdquo; So he took off his clothes and went into the tank to
bathe, and when he had bathed he put on fresh clothes, and
as he took hold of his fish to eat it, it slipped back alive
into the water, although it had been dead and cooked. The
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; sat down by the tank again, very sad. He said,
&ldquo;For twelve years I have found it hard to get anything to
eat; how long will God keep me without food?&rdquo; God was
very pleased with Harchand for being so patient, for he had
never complained.</p>

<p>Some days later God came down to earth in the shape
of a man, and with him he took an angel to be his
Waz&iacute;r. The Waz&iacute;r said to God, &ldquo;Come this way and let
us see who it is sitting by the tank.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said God, &ldquo;I
am too tired, I can go no further.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do come,&rdquo; said the
Waz&iacute;r; &ldquo;I want so much to go.&rdquo; God said, &ldquo;Well, let us
go.&rdquo; Then they walked on till they came to the place where
Harchand Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; was sitting, and God said to him,
&ldquo;Would you like to have your wife, and your son, and your
kingdom back again?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I should,&rdquo; said the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;;
&ldquo;but how can I get them?&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell me truly,&rdquo; said God,
&ldquo;would you like to have your kingdom back again?&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed
I should,&rdquo; said the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;. Then M&aacute;nikchand&rsquo;s
body, which had never sunk to the bottom of the tank like
the other bodies, but had always floated on the water, rose
up out of the water, and M&aacute;nikchand was alive once more.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
The father and son embraced each other. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said
God, &ldquo;let us go to the dom.&rdquo; Harchand Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; agreed,
and they went to the dom and asked him how much he
would take for Harchand Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;. The dom said, &ldquo;I
gave one pound of gold for him, and I will take two
pounds.&rdquo; So they paid down the two pounds of gold. Then
they went to the merchant and said to him, &ldquo;How much will
you take for H&iacute;r&aacute;l&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;?&rdquo; The merchant said, &ldquo;I gave a
pound of gold for her; I will take four pounds.&rdquo; So they paid
down the four pounds of gold, took H&iacute;r&aacute;l&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;, and went to
the cowherd. &ldquo;How much will you take for M&aacute;nikchand?&rdquo;
said they to him. &ldquo;I gave half a pound of gold for him,&rdquo;
answered the cowherd; &ldquo;I will take one pound.&rdquo; So they
paid down the pound of gold, and Harchand Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; went
home to his palace, taking with him H&iacute;r&aacute;l&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; and M&aacute;nikchand,
after thanking the strange man for his goodness to
them. When they reached the palace, the garden was in
splendid beauty; the charcoal was turned back into gold,
and silver, and jewels; the servants were in waiting as usual,
and they went into the palace and lived happily for evermore.</p>

LOVING LAIL&Iacute;.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxiv">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapo"><span class="dcap">O</span></span>NCE there was a king called King Dant&aacute;l, who had a
great many rupees and soldiers and horses. He
had also an only son called Prince Majn&uacute;n, who
was a handsome boy with white teeth, red lips, blue eyes, red
cheeks, red hair, and a white skin. This boy was very fond
of playing with the Waz&iacute;r&rsquo;s son, Husain Mah&aacute;mat, in King
Dant&aacute;l&rsquo;s garden, which was very large and full of delicious
fruits, and flowers, and trees. They used to take their little
knives there and cut the fruits and eat them. King Dant&aacute;l
had a teacher for them to teach them to read and write.</p>

<p>One day, when they were grown two fine young men,
Prince Majn&uacute;n said to his father, &ldquo;Husain Mah&aacute;mat and I
should like to go and hunt.&rdquo; His father said they might go,
so they got ready their horses and all else they wanted for
their hunting, and went to the Phal&aacute;n&aacute; country, hunting all
the way, but they only found jackals and birds.</p>

<p>The R&aacute;j&aacute; of the Phal&aacute;n&aacute; country was called M&uacute;ns&uacute;k
R&aacute;j&aacute;, and he had a daughter named Lail&iacute;, who was very
beautiful; she had brown eyes and black hair.</p>

<p>One night, some time before Prince Majn&uacute;n came to her
father&rsquo;s kingdom, as she slept, God sent to her an angel in
the form of a man who told her that she should marry Prince
Majn&uacute;n and no one else, and that this was God&rsquo;s command
to her. When Lail&iacute; woke she told her father of the angel&rsquo;s
visit to her as she slept; but her father paid no attention to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
her story. From that time she began repeating, &ldquo;Majn&uacute;n,
Majn&uacute;n; I want Majn&uacute;n,&rdquo; and would say nothing else. Even
as she sat and ate her food she kept saying, &ldquo;Majn&uacute;n, Majn&uacute;n;
I want Majn&uacute;n.&rdquo; Her father used to get quite vexed with
her. &ldquo;Who is this Majn&uacute;n? who ever heard of this Majn&uacute;n?&rdquo;
he would say. &ldquo;He is the man I am to marry,&rdquo;
said Lail&iacute;. &ldquo;God has ordered me to marry no one but
Majn&uacute;n.&rdquo; And she was half mad. Meanwhile, Majn&uacute;n and
Husain Mah&aacute;mat came to hunt in the Phal&aacute;n&aacute; country; and
as they were riding about, Lail&iacute; came out on her horse to
eat the air, and rode behind them. All the time she kept
saying, &ldquo;Majn&uacute;n, Majn&uacute;n; I want Majn&uacute;n.&rdquo; The prince
heard her, and turned round. &ldquo;Who is calling me?&rdquo; he
asked. At this Lail&iacute; looked at him, and the moment she
saw him she fell deeply in love with him, and she said to
herself, &ldquo;I am sure that is the Prince Majn&uacute;n that God says
I am to marry.&rdquo; And she went home to her father and said,
&ldquo;Father, I wish to marry the prince who has come to your
kingdom; for I know he is the Prince Majn&uacute;n I am to marry.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Very well, you shall have him for your husband,&rdquo; said M&uacute;ns&uacute;k
R&aacute;j&aacute;. &ldquo;We will ask him to-morrow.&rdquo; Lail&iacute; consented to wait,
although she was very impatient. As it happened, the prince
left the Phal&aacute;n&aacute; kingdom that night, and when Lail&iacute; heard he
was gone, she went quite mad. She would not listen to a word
her father, or her mother, or her servants said to her, but
went off into the jungle, and wandered from jungle to jungle,
till she got farther and farther away from her own country.
All the time she kept saying, &ldquo;Majn&uacute;n, Majn&uacute;n; I want
Majn&uacute;n;&rdquo; and so she wandered about for twelve years.</p>

<p>At the end of the twelve years she met a fak&iacute;r&mdash;he was
really an angel, but she did not know this&mdash;who asked her,
&ldquo;Why do you always say, &lsquo;Majn&uacute;n, Majn&uacute;n; I want Majn&uacute;n&rsquo;?&rdquo;
She answered, &ldquo;I am the daughter of the king of
the Phal&aacute;n&aacute; country, and I want to find Prince Majn&uacute;n; tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
me where his kingdom is.&rdquo; &ldquo;I think you will never get
there,&rdquo; said the fak&iacute;r, &ldquo;for it is very far from hence, and you
have to cross many rivers to reach it.&rdquo; But Lail&iacute; said she did
not care; she must see Prince Majn&uacute;n. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the
fak&iacute;r, &ldquo;when you come to the Bh&aacute;g&iacute;rath&iacute; river you will see a
big fish, a Roh&uacute;; and you must get him to carry you to
Prince Majn&uacute;n&rsquo;s country, or you will never reach it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went on and on, and at last she came to the Bh&aacute;g&iacute;rath&iacute;
river. There there was a great big fish called the Roh&uacute; fish.
It was yawning just as she got up to it, and she instantly
jumped down its throat into its stomach. All the time she
kept saying, &ldquo;Majn&uacute;n, Majn&uacute;n.&rdquo; At this the Roh&uacute; fish
was greatly alarmed and swam down the river as fast as he
could. By degrees he got tired and went slower, and a
crow came and perched on his back, and said, &ldquo;Caw, caw.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Crow,&rdquo; said the poor fish, &ldquo;do see what is in my
stomach that makes such a noise.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the
crow, &ldquo;open your mouth wide, and I&rsquo;ll fly down and see.&rdquo;
So the Roh&uacute; opened his jaws and the crow flew down, but
he came up again very quickly. &ldquo;You have a Rakshas in
your stomach,&rdquo; said the crow, and he flew away. This news
did not comfort the poor Roh&uacute;, and he swam on and on
till he came to Prince Majn&uacute;n&rsquo;s country. There he stopped.
And a jackal came down to the river to drink. &ldquo;Oh, jackal,&rdquo;
said the Roh&uacute;, &ldquo;do tell me what I have inside me.&rdquo; &ldquo;How
can I tell?&rdquo; said the jackal. &ldquo;I cannot see unless I go inside
you.&rdquo; So the Roh&uacute; opened his mouth wide, and the jackal
jumped down his throat; but he came up very quickly,
looking much frightened and saying, &ldquo;You have a Rakshas
in your stomach, and if I don&rsquo;t run away quickly, I am
afraid it will eat me.&rdquo; So off he ran. After the jackal
came an enormous snake. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says the fish, &ldquo;do tell me
what I have in my stomach, for it rattles about so, and keeps
saying, &lsquo;Majn&uacute;n, Majn&uacute;n; I want Majn&uacute;n.&rsquo;&rdquo; The snake said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
&ldquo;Open your mouth wide, and I&rsquo;ll go down and see what it
is.&rdquo; The snake went down: when he returned he said,
&ldquo;You have a Rakshas in your stomach; but if you will let
me cut you open, it will come out of you.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you do that,
I shall die,&rdquo; said the Roh&uacute;. &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the snake,
&ldquo;you will not, for I will give you a medicine that will make
you quite well again.&rdquo; So the fish agreed, and the snake
got a knife and cut him open, and out jumped Lail&iacute;.</p>

<p>She was now very old. Twelve years she had wandered
about the jungle, and for twelve years she had lived inside
her Roh&uacute;; and she was no longer beautiful, and had lost
her teeth. The snake took her on his back and carried her
into the country, and there he put her down, and she wandered
on and on till she got to Majn&uacute;n&rsquo;s court-house, where
King Majn&uacute;n was sitting. There some men heard her crying,
&ldquo;Majn&uacute;n, Majn&uacute;n; I want Majn&uacute;n,&rdquo; and they asked her
what she wanted. &ldquo;I want King Majn&uacute;n,&rdquo; she said. So they
went in and said to Prince Majn&uacute;n, &ldquo;An old woman outside
says she wants you.&rdquo; &ldquo;I cannot leave this place,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;send her in here.&rdquo; They brought her in and the prince
asked her what she wanted. &ldquo;I want to marry you,&rdquo; she
answered. &ldquo;Twenty-four years ago you came to my father
the Phal&aacute;n&aacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s country, and I wanted to marry you then;
but you went away without marrying me. Then I went
mad, and I have wandered about all these years looking for
you.&rdquo; Prince Majn&uacute;n said, &ldquo;Very good.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pray to God,&rdquo;
said Lail&iacute;, &ldquo;to make us both young again, and then we shall
be married.&rdquo; So the prince prayed to God, and God said
to him, &ldquo;Touch Lail&iacute;&rsquo;s clothes and they will catch fire, and
when they are on fire, she and you will become young again.&rdquo;
When he touched Lail&iacute;&rsquo;s clothes they caught fire, and she
and he became young again. And there were great feasts,
and they were married, and travelled to the Phal&aacute;n&aacute; country
to see her father and mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
Now Lail&iacute;&rsquo;s father and mother had wept so much for
their daughter that they had become quite blind, and her
father kept always repeating, &ldquo;Lail&iacute;, Lail&iacute;, Lail&iacute;.&rdquo; When
Lail&iacute; saw their blindness, she prayed to God to restore their
sight to them, which he did. As soon as the father and
mother saw Lail&iacute;, they hugged her and kissed her, and then
they had the wedding all over again amid great rejoicings.
Prince Majn&uacute;n and Lail&iacute; stayed with M&uacute;ns&uacute;k R&aacute;j&aacute; and his
wife for three years, and then they returned to King
Dant&aacute;l, and lived happily for some time with him.</p>

<p>They used to go out hunting, and they often went from
country to country to eat the air and amuse themselves.</p>

<p>One day Prince Majn&uacute;n said to Lail&iacute;, &ldquo;Let us go through
this jungle.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Lail&iacute;; &ldquo;if we go through this
jungle, some harm will happen to me.&rdquo; But Prince Majn&uacute;n
laughed, and went into the jungle. And as they were going
through it, God thought, &ldquo;I should like to know how much
Prince Majn&uacute;n loves his wife. Would he be very sorry if
she died? And would he marry another wife? I will see.&rdquo;
So he sent one of his angels in the form of a fak&iacute;r into the
jungle; and the angel went up to Lail&iacute;, and threw some powder
in her face, and instantly she fell to the ground a heap
of ashes.</p>

<p>Prince Majn&uacute;n was in great sorrow and grief when he
saw his dear Lail&iacute; turn into a little heap of ashes; and he
went straight home to his father, and for a long, long time
he would not be comforted. After a great many years he
grew more cheerful and happy, and began to go again into
his father&rsquo;s beautiful garden with Husain Mah&aacute;mat. King
Dant&aacute;l wished his son to marry again. &ldquo;I will only have
Lail&iacute; for my wife; I will not marry any other woman,&rdquo; said
Prince Majn&uacute;n. &ldquo;How can you marry Lail&iacute;? Lail&iacute; is
dead. She will never come back to you,&rdquo; said the father.
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll not have any wife at all,&rdquo; said Prince Majn&uacute;n.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
Meanwhile Lail&iacute; was living in the jungle where her husband
had left her a little heap of ashes. As soon as Majn&uacute;n
had gone, the fak&iacute;r had taken her ashes and made them
quite clean, and then he had mixed clay and water with the
ashes, and made the figure of a woman with them, and so
Lail&iacute; regained her human form, and God sent life into it.
But Lail&iacute; had become once more a hideous old woman, with
a long, long nose, and teeth like tusks; just such an old
woman, excepting her teeth, as she had been when she came
out of the Roh&uacute; fish; and she lived in the jungle, and neither
ate nor drank, and she kept on saying, &ldquo;Majn&uacute;n, Majn&uacute;n;
I want Majn&uacute;n.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last the angel who had come as a fak&iacute;r and thrown the
powder at her, said to God, &ldquo;Of what use is it that this
woman should sit in the jungle crying, crying for ever,
&lsquo;Majn&uacute;n, Majn&uacute;n; I want Majn&uacute;n,&rsquo; and eating and drinking
nothing? Let me take her to Prince Majn&uacute;n.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
God, &ldquo;you may do so; but tell her that she must not
speak to Majn&uacute;n if he is afraid of her when he sees her;
and that if he is afraid when he sees her, she will become a
little white dog the next day. Then she must go to the palace,
and she will only regain her human shape when Prince
Majn&uacute;n loves her, feeds her with his own food, and lets her
sleep in his bed.&rdquo; So the angel came to Lail&iacute; again as a
fak&iacute;r and carried her to King Dant&aacute;l&rsquo;s garden. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;it is God&rsquo;s command that you stay here till Prince
Majn&uacute;n comes to walk in the garden, and then you may
show yourself to him. But you must not speak to him, if he
is afraid of you; and should he be afraid of you, you will
the next day become a little white dog.&rdquo; He then told her
what she must do as a little dog to regain her human form.</p>

<p>Lail&iacute; stayed in the garden, hidden in the tall grass, till
Prince Majn&uacute;n and Husain Mah&aacute;mat came to walk in the
garden. King Dant&aacute;l was now a very old man, and Husain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
Mah&aacute;mat, though he was really only as old as Prince Majn&uacute;n,
looked a great deal older than the prince, who had been
made quite young again when he married Lail&iacute;.</p>

<p>As Prince Majn&uacute;n and the Waz&iacute;r&rsquo;s son walked in the
garden, they gathered the fruit as they had done as little
children, only they bit the fruit with their teeth; they did not
cut it. While Majn&uacute;n was busy eating a fruit in this way,
and was talking to Husain Mah&aacute;mat, he turned towards him
and saw Lail&iacute; walking behind the Waz&iacute;r&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Oh, look,
look!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;see what is following you; it is a Rakshas
or a demon, and I am sure it is going to eat us.&rdquo; Lail&iacute; looked
at him beseechingly with all her eyes, and trembled with age
and eagerness; but this only frightened Majn&uacute;n the more.
&ldquo;It is a Rakshas, a Rakshas!&rdquo; he cried, and he ran quickly
to the palace with the Waz&iacute;r&rsquo;s son; and as they ran away,
Lail&iacute; disappeared into the jungle. They ran to King Dant&aacute;l,
and Majn&uacute;n told him there was a Rakshas or a demon in the
garden that had come to eat them. &ldquo;What nonsense,&rdquo; said
his father. &ldquo;Fancy two grown men being so frightened by
an old ayah or a fak&iacute;r! And if it had been a Rakshas, it
would not have eaten you.&rdquo; Indeed King Dant&aacute;l did not
believe Majn&uacute;n had seen anything at all, till Husain Mah&aacute;mat
said the prince was speaking the exact truth. They
had the garden searched for the terrible old woman, but
found nothing, and King Dant&aacute;l told his son he was very
silly to be so much frightened. However, Prince Majn&uacute;n
would not walk in the garden any more.</p>

<p>The next day Lail&iacute; turned into a pretty little dog; and in
this shape she came into the palace, where Prince Majn&uacute;n
soon became very fond of her. She followed him everywhere,
went with him when he was out hunting, and helped
him to catch his game, and Prince Majn&uacute;n fed her with
milk, or bread, or anything else he was eating, and at night
the little dog slept in his bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
But one night the little dog disappeared, and in its stead
there lay the little old woman who had frightened him so
much in the garden; and now Prince Majn&uacute;n was quite sure
she was a Rakshas, or a demon, or some such horrible thing
come to eat him; and in his terror he cried out, &ldquo;What do
you want? Oh, do not eat me; do not eat me!&rdquo; Poor
Lail&iacute; answered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me? I am your wife
Lail&iacute;, and I want to marry you. Don&rsquo;t you remember how
you would go through that jungle, though I begged and
begged you not to go, for I told you that harm would happen
to me, and then a fak&iacute;r came and threw powder in my
face, and I became a heap of ashes. But God gave me my
life again, and brought me here, after I had stayed a long,
long while in the jungle crying for you, and now I am
obliged to be a little dog; but if you will marry me, I shall
not be a little dog any more.&rdquo; Majn&uacute;n, however, said
&ldquo;How can I marry an old woman like you? how can you
be Lail&iacute;? I am sure you are a Rakshas or a demon come
to eat me,&rdquo; and he was in great terror.</p>

<p>In the morning the old woman had turned into the little
dog, and the prince went to his father and told him all that
had happened. &ldquo;An old woman! an old woman! always
an old woman!&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;You do nothing but
think of old women. How can a strong man like you be
so easily frightened?&rdquo; However, when he saw that his son
was really in great terror, and that he really believed the
old woman would come back at night, he advised him to
say to her, &ldquo;I will marry you if you can make yourself a
young girl again. How can I marry such an old woman as
you are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night as he lay trembling in bed the little old woman
lay there in place of the dog, crying, &ldquo;Majn&uacute;n, Majn&uacute;n, I
want to marry you. I have loved you all these long, long
years. When I was in my father&rsquo;s kingdom a young girl, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
knew of you, though you knew nothing of me, and we
should have been married then if you had not gone away
so suddenly, and for long, long years I followed you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Majn&uacute;n, &ldquo;if you can make yourself a young
girl again, I will marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lail&iacute; said, &ldquo;Oh, that is quite easy. God will make me a
young girl again. In two days&rsquo; time you must go into the
garden, and there you will see a beautiful fruit. You must
gather it and bring it into your room and cut it open yourself
very gently, and you must not open it when your father
or anybody else is with you, but when you are quite alone;
for I shall be in the fruit quite naked, without any clothes at
all on.&rdquo; In the morning Lail&iacute; took her little dog&rsquo;s form, and
disappeared in the garden.</p>

<p>Prince Majn&uacute;n told all this to his father, who told him to
do all the old woman had bidden him. In two days&rsquo; time
he and the Waz&iacute;r&rsquo;s son walked in the garden, and there
they saw a large, lovely red fruit. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the Prince,
&ldquo;I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit.&rdquo; Husain
Mah&aacute;mat wanted him to gather it and see, but he would
not till he had told his father, who said, &ldquo;That must be
the fruit; go and gather it.&rdquo; So Majn&uacute;n went back and
broke the fruit off its stalk; and he said to his father,
&ldquo;Come with me to my room while I open it; I am
afraid to open it alone, for perhaps I shall find a Rakshas
in it that will eat me.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said King Dant&aacute;l; &ldquo;remember,
Lail&iacute; will be naked; you must go alone, and do not be
afraid if, after all, a Rakshas is in the fruit, for I will stay
outside the door, and you have only to call me with a loud
voice, and I will come to you, so the Rakshas will not be
able to eat you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Majn&uacute;n took the fruit and began to cut it open
tremblingly, for he shook with fear; and when he had cut
it, out stepped Lail&iacute;, young and far more beautiful than she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
had ever been. At the sight of her extreme beauty, Majn&uacute;n
fell backwards fainting on the floor.</p>

<p>Lail&iacute; took off his turban and wound it all round herself
like a s&aacute;r&iacute; (for she had no clothes at all on), and then she
called King Dant&aacute;l, and said to him sadly, &ldquo;Why has Majn&uacute;n
fallen down like this? Why will he not speak to me?
He never used to be afraid of me; and he has seen me so
many, many times.&rdquo; King Dant&aacute;l answered, &ldquo;It is because
you are so beautiful. You are far, far more beautiful than
you ever were. But he will be very happy directly.&rdquo; Then
the King got some water, and they bathed Majn&uacute;n&rsquo;s face
and gave him some to drink, and he sat up again. Then
Lail&iacute; said, &ldquo;Why did you faint? Did you not see I am
Lail&iacute;?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Prince Majn&uacute;n, &ldquo;I see you are Lail&iacute;
come back to me, but your eyes have grown so wonderfully
beautiful, that I fainted when I saw them.&rdquo; Then they were
all very happy, and King Dant&aacute;l had all the drums in the
place beaten, and had all the musical instruments played on,
and they made a grand wedding-feast, and gave presents to
the servants, and rice and quantities of rupees to the fak&iacute;rs.</p>

<p>After some time had passed very happily, Prince Majn&uacute;n
and his wife went out to eat the air. They rode on the
same horse, and had only a groom with them. They came
to another kingdom, to a beautiful garden. &ldquo;We must go
into that garden and see it,&rdquo; said Majn&uacute;n. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said
Lail&iacute;; &ldquo;it belongs to a bad R&aacute;j&aacute;, Chumman B&aacute;s&aacute;, a very
wicked man.&rdquo; But Majn&uacute;n insisted on going in, and in
spite of all Lail&iacute; could say, he got off the horse to look at
the flowers. Now, as he was looking at the flowers, Lail&iacute; saw
Chumman B&aacute;s&aacute; coming towards them, and she read in his
eyes that he meant to kill her husband and seize her. So
she said to Majn&uacute;n, &ldquo;Come, come, let us go; do not go near
that bad man. I see in his eyes, and I feel in my heart,
that he will kill you to seize me.&rdquo; &ldquo;What nonsense,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
Majn&uacute;n. &ldquo;I believe he is a very good R&aacute;j&aacute;. Anyhow, I
am so near to him that I could not get away.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
Lail&iacute;, &ldquo;it is better that you should be killed than I, for if I
were to be killed a second time, God would not give me my
life again; but I can bring you to life if you are killed.&rdquo;
Now Chumman B&aacute;s&aacute; had come quite near, and seemed very
pleasant, so thought Prince Majn&uacute;n; but when he was
speaking to Majn&uacute;n, he drew his scimitar and cut off the
prince&rsquo;s head at one blow.</p>

<p>Lail&iacute; sat quite still on her horse, and as the R&aacute;j&aacute; came
towards her she said, &ldquo;Why did you kill my husband?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Because I want to take you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You cannot,&rdquo;
said Lail&iacute;. &ldquo;Yes, I can,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute;. &ldquo;Take me, then,&rdquo;
said Lail&iacute; to Chumman B&aacute;s&aacute;; so he came quite close and
put out his hand to take hers to lift her off her horse. But
she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a tiny knife,
only as long as her hand was broad, and this knife unfolded
itself in one instant till it was such a length! and then Lail&iacute;
made a great sweep with her arm and her long, long knife,
and off came Chumman B&aacute;s&aacute;&rsquo;s head at one touch.</p>

<p>Then Lail&iacute; slipped down off her horse, and she went to
Majn&uacute;n&rsquo;s dead body, and she cut her little finger inside her
hand straight down from the top of her nail to her palm,
and out of this gushed blood like healing medicine. Then
she put Majn&uacute;n&rsquo;s head on his shoulders, and smeared her
healing blood all over the wound, and Majn&uacute;n woke up and
said, &ldquo;What a delightful sleep I have had! Why, I feel as
if I had slept for years!&rdquo; Then he got up and saw the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s
dead body by Lail&iacute;&rsquo;s horse. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Majn&uacute;n.
&ldquo;That is the wicked R&aacute;j&aacute; who killed you to seize me, just as I
said he would.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who killed him?&rdquo; asked Majn&uacute;n. &ldquo;I did,&rdquo;
answered Lail&iacute;, &ldquo;and it was I who brought you to life.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do
bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so,&rdquo; said
Majn&uacute;n. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lail&iacute;, &ldquo;for he is a wicked man, and will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
try to do you harm.&rdquo; But Majn&uacute;n asked her for such a long
time, and so earnestly to bring the wicked R&aacute;j&aacute; to life, that
at last she said, &ldquo;Jump up on the horse, then, and go far
away with the groom.&rdquo; &ldquo;What will you do,&rdquo; said Majn&uacute;n,
&ldquo;if I leave you? I cannot leave you.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will take care
of myself,&rdquo; said Lail&iacute;; &ldquo;but this man is so wicked, he may
kill you again if you are near him.&rdquo; So Majn&uacute;n got up on the
horse, and he and the groom went a long way off and waited
for Lail&iacute;. Then she set the wicked R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s head straight on
his shoulders, and she squeezed the wound in her finger till
a little blood-medicine came out of it. Then she smeared
this over the place where her knife had passed, and just as
she saw the R&aacute;j&aacute; opening his eyes, she began to run, and
she ran, and ran so fast, that she outran the R&aacute;j&aacute;, who tried
to catch her; and she sprang up on the horse behind her
husband, and they rode so fast, so fast, till they reached
King Dant&aacute;l&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>There Prince Majn&uacute;n told everything to his father, who
was horrified and angry. &ldquo;How lucky for you that you
have such a wife,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why did you not do what she
told you? But for her, you would be now dead.&rdquo; Then he
made a great feast out of gratitude for his son&rsquo;s safety, and
gave many, many rupees to the fak&iacute;rs. And he made so much
of Lail&iacute;. He loved her dearly; he could not do enough for
her. Then he built a splendid palace for her and his son,
with a great deal of ground about it, and lovely gardens,
and gave them great wealth, and heaps of servants to wait
on them. But he would not allow any but their servants to
enter their gardens and palace, and he would not allow
Majn&uacute;n to go out of them, nor Lail&iacute;; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said King
Dant&aacute;l, &ldquo;Lail&iacute; is so beautiful, that perhaps some one may
kill my son to take her away.&rdquo;</p>

HOW KING BURTAL BECAME A FAK&Iacute;R.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxv">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapo"><span class="dcap">O</span></span>NCE there was a great king called Burtal, and he
had a hundred and sixty wives, but he had no
children, which made him sad. One day he said
to his wives, &ldquo;I am going to a very distant jungle which is
full of antelopes, to hunt them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; they answered,
&ldquo;go.&rdquo; So he went. In that jungle lived neither tigers nor
men, but only antelopes. When King Burtal reached the
jungle, some of the antelopes came to him and said, &ldquo;Pray
don&rsquo;t kill the black antelope, for he is our R&aacute;j&aacute;, and we have
no other antelope like him among us; but try to kill any of
the others&mdash;the brown or the yellow antelopes&mdash;that you
choose.&rdquo; Now, the king was not a kind man, and he said,
&ldquo;I will kill your black antelope, and no other.&rdquo; So he shot
him dead. When the other antelopes saw this they began
to scream and cry with sorrow. But the dead antelope&rsquo;s
wife said to them, &ldquo;There is a holy man, a fak&iacute;r, in the
jungle. Let us take the dead body to him and ask him to
bring our R&aacute;j&aacute; to life.&rdquo; And King Burtal laughed at them
and said, &ldquo;How can any man bring a dead antelope to
life?&rdquo; But the antelopes took the body of their dead R&aacute;j&aacute;
on their backs, and the dead antelope&rsquo;s wife went at their
head; and King Burtal went too; and they carried it to the
fak&iacute;r, who was called Gorakn&aacute;th, and who was resting in the
jungle, and they said to him, &ldquo;Bring our R&aacute;j&aacute; to life again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
for what can we do without a R&aacute;j&aacute;? and he has left no son
to succeed him.&rdquo; And the queen antelope said, &ldquo;I have
no other husband. I had only this one husband. Do bring
him to life for me.&rdquo; King Burtal laughed and mocked them,
and said to the fak&iacute;r, &ldquo;I never heard of any man being able
to bring a dead antelope to life. I don&rsquo;t believe you can
do it.&rdquo; At this Gorakn&aacute;th got angry, and he knelt down
and asked God to bring the antelope to life; and God told
him to take a wand and beat the dead antelope with it, and
then the antelope would be alive again. So Gorakn&aacute;th took
a wand and beat the dead antelope, and it was alive once
more, and then it instantly sprang up into heaven. The
antelopes were delighted to see their R&aacute;j&aacute; alive again, and
they said, &ldquo;We do not mind his going up to heaven, for he
will come down again to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>King Burtal had stood by all the time, and he said to
Gorakn&aacute;th, &ldquo;Make me a fak&iacute;r like yourself,&rdquo; for he thought
it would be fine to do such wonderful things. But Gorakn&aacute;th
would not, and King Burtal stayed in the jungle with
Gorakn&aacute;th for twelve years, and all that time he never ceased
begging and praying to be made a fak&iacute;r, till at last Gorakn&aacute;th
said, &ldquo;I cannot make you a fak&iacute;r unless you go home
and address your wives as &lsquo;Mamma,&rsquo; and ask them to give
you money and food.&rdquo; Now, it is a very shameful thing
to call one&rsquo;s wife &lsquo;Mamma,&rsquo; for if a wife is called &lsquo;Mamma&rsquo;
she has to leave her husband. Then Gorakn&aacute;th took off
the king&rsquo;s clothes, and dressed him only in a cloth and a
tiger&rsquo;s skin; and the king went to his palace and began
begging for rice and food, and he would not take any from
the palace servants: he said he must and would see the
R&aacute;n&iacute;s, and that they themselves should give him food. The
servants told the R&aacute;n&iacute;s about this fak&iacute;r who said he must
and would see them himself, and that they should give him
food and rice with their own hands, and one of their ayahs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
who had recognized King Burtal, told them the fak&iacute;r was
their husband who had been away twelve years. The R&aacute;n&iacute;s
cried out, &ldquo;Do not talk nonsense. That fak&iacute;r can never be
our husband.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go and see for yourselves,&rdquo; answered the
ayah. They went, and the fak&iacute;r said to them, &ldquo;Mamma,
give me rice.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why do you call us &lsquo;Mamma&rsquo;?&rdquo; they said.
&ldquo;We have no sons. You are not our son.&rdquo; But at last they
saw he was indeed their husband, and they wrung their hands
and wept bitterly, and threw themselves on the ground before
him and said, &ldquo;Why have you called us &lsquo;Mamma&rsquo;?
Why do you ask for bread? We must now leave you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Take my kingdom, my
money, my houses, and stay here till I return. I am going
to be a fak&iacute;r.&rdquo; His wives gave him some rice and some
money, and he went back to Gorakn&aacute;th.</p>

<p>In old days men who intended to become fak&iacute;rs had to
do three tasks set them by one who was already a fak&iacute;r; so
Gorakn&aacute;th said to the king, &ldquo;Now you must go to a jungle
that I will show you, and stay there for twelve years.&rdquo; Then
King Burtal took the flat pan and the rolling-pin which he
used in making his flour cakes, and was quite ready to start
for the jungle, but the fak&iacute;r stopped him. &ldquo;You must leave
your pan and your rolling-pin behind,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and all
these twelve years you must neither eat nor drink, or you
can never be a fak&iacute;r. You must sit quite still on the same
spot and never move.&rdquo; &ldquo;I shall die if I don&rsquo;t eat,&rdquo; said
the king; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t care if I do die, so I will do all you
tell me.&rdquo; Then the fak&iacute;r took him to a jungle, and made
him sit down on the grass, and instantly all the grass round
him grew up so tall and thick that King Burtal was quite
hidden by it, and no one could see him. Here he lived for
twelve years, and never moved, and he ate nothing, and
drank nothing, and nobody knew he was there.</p>

<p>At the end of that time Gorakn&aacute;th came and took him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
away and said, &ldquo;Now go home to your wives.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why should
I go to my wives? I do not wish to see my wives, for they
have given me no children,&rdquo; said King Burtal. But Gorakn&aacute;th
said, &ldquo;Go and see them.&rdquo; So King Burtal went; and
he begged for rice from them; and they entreated him to
stay with them, but he would not. &ldquo;I will return to the
fak&iacute;r Gorakn&aacute;th,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why should I stay with you?
You have never given me a child. What use is all my wealth
to me? I have no son to take it when I am dead. I will
become a fak&iacute;r.&rdquo; And they threw themselves on the ground
and wrung their hands, and said, &ldquo;Oh, why will you leave
us?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Because it pleases me to do so.&rdquo;
And he called them all &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; and told them to stay
in his palace and take all he possessed for their own use.
Then he returned to Gorakn&aacute;th.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Gorakn&aacute;th, &ldquo;you must learn to be sweeper
to all the beasts of the jungle, and you must serve them for
twelve years.&rdquo; So for twelve years King Burtal cleared the
grass and kept the jungle clean for all the creatures in it&mdash;cows,
sheep, goats, tigers, cats, bears. Sometimes he stayed
in one part of the jungle, and sometimes in another.</p>

<p>When the twelve years were over he went to Gorakn&aacute;th,
who said to him, &ldquo;Good; you have learnt to serve the wild
beasts; now you must learn to serve men.&rdquo; Then the fak&iacute;r
took the king to a village, and bade him sweep it and keep
it clean for twelve years. Here King Burtal stayed for another
twelve years, and all that time he was the village-sweeper
and kept the village clean, and he swept all the
dust and dirt into a great heap till the heap was as high and
as big as a hut.</p>

<p>When the twelve years were over he returned to Gorakn&aacute;th
and stood before him, and as he stood there came a
man who was an angel sent by God, and he threw some
dirt on King Burtal&rsquo;s head; but the king never moved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
nor spoke. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; cried Gorakn&aacute;th, &ldquo;I see you are a
true fak&iacute;r: go and cleanse yourself by bathing in the
river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The river in which he was sent to bathe was the Jamn&aacute;.
In this river lived water-nymphs, and the nymph Gang&aacute; was
playing in it when her sister Jamn&aacute;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> came to her and said,
&ldquo;Come quickly; our father is dying and wants to see you;&rdquo;
and off Jamn&aacute; went to her father. Gang&aacute; was hurrying
after her when King Burtal saw her, and stopped her, and
asked her where she was going so fast. &ldquo;To my father, who
is very ill and dying,&rdquo; said Gang&aacute;; &ldquo;let me go.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will
not let you go,&rdquo; said King Burtal. Then Gang&aacute; began to run,
and said, &ldquo;You cannot keep me, you cannot catch me; no
man can catch me, no man can keep me.&rdquo; This provoked
King Burtal, and he said, &ldquo;I can catch you, and I can keep
you.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;no one can catch me, no
one can hold me.&rdquo; Then King Burtal got quite vexed, and
he ran till he caught her, and then he said, &ldquo;Now, I will not
let you go; I will keep you.&rdquo; Then he held her in his hands
and rubbed her between his palms, and when he opened his
hands she had turned into a little round ball. He tried to
hide the ball in his hair, but could not, for his hair was too
short, and he found he could not hold Gang&aacute;, as she was
too strong for him; so he thought he would take her to
Mah&aacute;deo,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who had long thick hair, and make him keep her,
for King Burtal was dreadfully frightened and did not dare
let the ball go, for fear Gang&aacute;, who he knew was very angry,
should take her own form and bring a great flood to drown
him. So he went quickly to Mah&aacute;deo, and gave the ball to
him. Mah&aacute;deo said, &ldquo;Why not keep her yourself?&rdquo; &ldquo;I
cannot,&rdquo; said King Burtal, &ldquo;for my hair is too short to tie
her into; and I cannot hold her, for she is too strong for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
me; but your hair is long, and so you can hide her in it.&rdquo;
Then Mah&aacute;deo had a round box made of bamboo, and in
this box was a hole into which he dropped the ball. And
he let down his long hair, and it reached to the ground, and
was thick&mdash;so thick; he put the box in his hair on the top
of his head, and rolled his long hair all round his head and
over the box just like a turban.</p>

<p>Jamn&aacute; finding her sister did not follow her, came up from
the bottom of the river to look for her, and she asked
whether any one had seen her, and at last some one said,
&ldquo;King Burtal has taken her away.&rdquo; Jamn&aacute; set off to King
Burtal and said, &ldquo;Give me my sister Gang&aacute;, for our father
is dying and wants to see her.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is true that I took her
away,&rdquo; said King Burtal, &ldquo;but I have not got her now; she
is with Mah&aacute;deo.&rdquo; So Jamn&aacute; went to Mah&aacute;deo,&mdash;&ldquo;Give
me my sister quickly, for our father is dying and wants to see
her.&rdquo; (Now Gang&aacute; was in a great passion inside her box.)
&ldquo;I cannot give you Gang&aacute;,&rdquo; said Mah&aacute;deo, &ldquo;for she is so
angry that if I let her loose she will flood the country with
water.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, she will not; indeed, she will not,&rdquo; said Jamn&aacute;.
&ldquo;If I give her to you, you will not be able to keep her,&rdquo; said
Mah&aacute;deo. &ldquo;Yes, yes, I shall,&rdquo; said Jamn&aacute;. &ldquo;I do not
think you will,&rdquo; said Mah&aacute;deo; &ldquo;but here is the box in which
said is. Hold it tight, and be careful that neither you nor
any one else mentions her name on the journey.&rdquo; Jamn&aacute;
said she would be very careful, and took the box; but she
had to pass through a jungle in which were a number of
cowherds and holy men, one of whom was called Gang&aacute;.
Just as Jamn&aacute; passed by, one of these men called to this
man by his name, Gang&aacute;, and instantly Gang&aacute; burst the box
and flooded the country with water. The holy men and the
cowherd called to her to have pity on them, and so did
Jamn&aacute;; but Gang&aacute; was too angry to listen to them or speak
to them, so she drowned all the holy men and the cowherds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
and when she got to her father&rsquo;s house and found he was
dead, she was in such a rage that she declared she would
send a still greater flood to ruin the country; and so she
did.</p>

<p>After this, King Burtal went to Gorakn&aacute;th and stayed
with him some years, till Gorakn&aacute;th said, &ldquo;Now go to your
own kingdom.&rdquo; But King Burtal refused, saying, &ldquo;I wish
to stay with you; my wives have never given me a child. I
have no son. I do not care to return to my kingdom.&rdquo;
However, Gorakn&aacute;th would not allow him to stay. &ldquo;Go
to your own kingdom,&rdquo; he said again; &ldquo;but first tell me how
many wives you have.&rdquo; &ldquo;A hundred and sixty,&rdquo; answered
the King. &ldquo;Here are a hundred and sixty l&iacute;ch&iacute; fruits for
you,&rdquo; said the fak&iacute;r. &ldquo;Give one to each of your wives to
eat, and they will each have a son, and I will go with
you.&rdquo; So King Burtal obeyed, and Gorakn&aacute;th went with
him.</p>

<p>Seventy years had passed since King Burtal had left his
kingdom. When he and Gorakn&aacute;th reached it, they went
to an open plain and made a fire and sat down beside it.
Everybody who passed them said, &ldquo;Who are these fak&iacute;rs?&rdquo;
Some servants of King Burtal&rsquo;s R&aacute;n&iacute;s passed too, and when
they got home they told the R&aacute;n&iacute;s that their husband had
returned to his kingdom. But the R&aacute;n&iacute;s said, &ldquo;What nonsense
you talk! King Burtal went away with the fak&iacute;r
Gorakn&aacute;th.&rdquo; The servants answered, &ldquo;We are quite sure
that King Burtal is here, for Gorakn&aacute;th is here, and with him
is another man, and we are sure this man is King Burtal.&rdquo;
So all the R&aacute;n&iacute;s went to see for themselves, and when they
saw the fak&iacute;r that was with Gorakn&aacute;th they knew he was their
husband. Then the first R&aacute;n&iacute;, who was very angry with him
for having left them, said a spell over him: &ldquo;God is very
angry with you for leaving us, and he will send you a bad
illness.&rdquo; But King Burtal answered, &ldquo;Do not be angry with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
me. I am your husband, and have come back to you after
an absence of seventy years.&rdquo; At this the youngest R&aacute;n&iacute;
was very glad, and she ordered drums to be beaten and she
beat a drum herself, and they sang songs, and all went to
the palace together, and Gorakn&aacute;th with them.</p>

<p>Then Gorakn&aacute;th said he must now go away, but first he
asked King Burtal to show him a grand feat as a proof of his
skill. So King Burtal sent to the smith for a great iron
chain. Then he lit a big fire. This alarmed the palace
servants, who wondered if he were going to burn his palace
and his wives. King Burtal next sent for some ghee. &ldquo;What
is he going to do with the ghee?&rdquo; said the palace servants.
Then he drove a nail into the wall, rubbed his hands with the
ghee, put the iron chain into the fire and drew it out red-hot;
flames came from the iron. Then King Burtal hung it on
the nail and pulled and pulled at the chain till he drew it off
the nail, and his hands were not in the least burnt. The
R&aacute;n&iacute;s and palace servants were greatly astonished and Gorakn&aacute;th
much pleased. &ldquo;You know how to do your work well,&rdquo;
said he to the king. Then Gorakn&aacute;th bade him good bye,
telling him to look after his kingdom and his wives; but
they all said he must not leave them, and they built him a
grand house in the compound, and gave him a great many
servants to wait on him, and plenty of money; so Gorakn&aacute;th
agreed to live in this house; only, as he was a fak&iacute;r, he often
went away by himself to spend some time in his jungle,
always returning to his house in King Burtal&rsquo;s compound.
Meanwhile King Burtal gave each of his wives a l&iacute;ch&iacute; to eat,
and after a little while each wife had a little son. They
were all such beautiful children; but the biggest and handsomest
of all was the eldest R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s little son. His name was
Saz&aacute;d&aacute;, and his father and mother loved him dearly.</p>

<p>When Prince Saz&aacute;d&aacute; was about six or seven years old, the
fak&iacute;r Gorakn&aacute;th came to King Burtal and said, &ldquo;Now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
you must give me your son Saz&aacute;d&aacute;, for I want to take
him away with me for some years.&rdquo; The R&aacute;n&iacute;, his mother,
refused to let him go, but at last she had to do so, and then
she became mad and very sick for grief.</p>

<p>Gorakn&aacute;th took the little prince to Indr&aacute;san to be taught
by the fairies, and on arriving he married him to Jah&uacute;r
R&aacute;n&iacute;, who was the daughter of the greatest of the fairy queens.
Gorakn&aacute;th made a grand wedding for the little prince, and
all the fairies were delighted that he should be the little
Jah&uacute;r R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s husband, for he was such a beautiful child they
all fell in love with him the moment they saw him, and they
taught him to play on all kinds of instruments, and to sing
beautifully, and to read and write, and he grew handsomer
and handsomer every day in the fairy kingdom. Gorakn&aacute;th
came often to see him, and the fairies took great care of him.</p>

<p>When Prince Saz&aacute;d&aacute; had grown a fine strong young man,
Gorakn&aacute;th took him and his wife, the Jah&uacute;r R&aacute;n&iacute;, and brought
them in great state to King Burtal&rsquo;s kingdom. First he took
the young prince and presented him to his father and said,
&ldquo;See, here is your son. Now he can read and write, sing and
play on all kinds of instruments, for I have had him taught
all these things.&rdquo; But they, when they saw him, fell on their
faces, for they could not look at him on account of his great
beauty. He had grown so handsome in Indr&aacute;san, and his
cheeks were red. &ldquo;How can this beautiful boy be our son?&rdquo;
they said, and they did not recognize him. &ldquo;Stand up,&rdquo;
said Gorakn&aacute;th. &ldquo;This is your son Saz&aacute;d&aacute;; do not fall
down before your son.&rdquo; So they stood up, and the fak&iacute;r
said, &ldquo;I have married your son to the fairy princess Jah&uacute;r
R&aacute;n&iacute;, and I will bring her to you.&rdquo; So then he brought
the little R&aacute;n&iacute;, and when they saw her they fell down again,
for they could not look at her beauty. Her hair was like
red gold, her eyes were dark, and her eyelashes black. But
Gorakn&aacute;th made them stand up; and when they really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
understood it was their son and his wife that he had brought
them, they took Prince Saz&aacute;d&aacute; into their arms, and kissed
him and loved him, and his R&aacute;n&iacute; too. Gorakn&aacute;th made a
grand wedding-feast for them all, and they were all very
happy.</p>

SOME OF THE DOINGS OF SHEKH FAR&Iacute;D.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxvi">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapo"><span class="dcap">O</span></span>NCE there was a R&aacute;j&aacute; called H&aacute;m&aacute;ns&aacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;. He
had a son, named Gursan R&aacute;j&aacute;, who married
Khel&aacute;par&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;, the daughter of Gul&aacute;bs&aacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;.
After the wedding Gursan R&aacute;j&aacute; brought her home to his
father&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>One day Gursan R&aacute;j&aacute; came home from hunting, very very
tired and thirsty. It was about twelve or one o&rsquo;clock in the
day. He asked Khel&aacute;par&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; to fetch him some water,
and while she went for it he fell asleep. When she came
back she found him still sleeping, and because he was so
tired he slept all the afternoon and all night, and never woke
till the next morning. His wife stood by him all the time
holding the water in a brass cup. When he woke and
found she had stood there all the afternoon and all night he
was very sorry, and asked God to forgive him, and to give his
wife whatever she wished for, no matter what it might be.
So Khel&aacute;par&iacute; wished that whatever happened in any country,
she might know of it at once of herself without any one
telling her, no matter how far away the country might be.</p>

<p>One day Khel&aacute;par&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; went to draw water from the
tank, and by the tank sat an old man, the fak&iacute;r Shekh Far&iacute;d.
He said to the R&aacute;n&iacute;, &ldquo;Give me a little water to drink.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;only drink it quickly, for my father&rsquo;s
house is on fire, and I am going to put it out.&rdquo; &ldquo;How far
off is your father&rsquo;s country?&rdquo; asked Shekh Far&iacute;d. &ldquo;About
twenty miles,&rdquo; answered Khel&aacute;par&iacute;. &ldquo;Then how can you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
know his house is on fire!&rdquo; said Shekh Far&iacute;d; &ldquo;I have been
a fak&iacute;r for twelve years, and for twelve years neither ate nor
drank, and yet I do not know what happens twenty miles
away.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I know,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Leave your water-jar
here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and go and see if the house really is on
fire, and I will not drink till you return to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So off went Khel&aacute;par&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; to her father&rsquo;s country, and
when she got there his house was burning, and she stayed
till the fire was put out, and then returned to the tank where
she left the fak&iacute;r. &ldquo;Is it true,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that your
father&rsquo;s house was on fire?&rdquo; &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; she answered.
The fak&iacute;r wondered. &ldquo;How could she know it when the
fire was twenty miles off?&rdquo; he said to himself, and he determined
to go to Gul&aacute;bs&aacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s country to see if the R&aacute;n&iacute;
had told him the truth.</p>

<p>He went by a roundabout road, as he did not know the
way, so it took him three or four days to get there. When
he did, he asked some villagers if there had been a fire at
their R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;Yes, a few days ago there was,&rdquo; they
answered. So the fak&iacute;r, still more astonished, decided he
would go back to H&aacute;m&aacute;ns&aacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s palace and ask Khel&aacute;par&iacute;
R&aacute;n&iacute; how it came to pass that she was wiser than Shekh
Far&iacute;d.</p>

<p>As he was returning, he met a bullock-cart laden with bags
of sugar, and he asked the driver what the bags contained.
The driver was put out because his bullocks would not go
on quickly, and he was tired with beating and goading them,
so he said crossly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ashes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Shekh Far&iacute;d,
&ldquo;let it be ashes.&rdquo; When the cartman got to the bazar, and
went to make over the sugar to the merchant who had sent
him for it, he found all his bags full of ashes, nothing but
ashes. He was in a great state of mind, for a good deal
of money had been paid for the sugar, and he was a poor
man. So he went back to Shekh Far&iacute;d and fell down at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
feet, saying, &ldquo;I am a poor, poor man. My sugar is turned
to ashes. Do make the ashes sugar again.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said
the fak&iacute;r; &ldquo;go home, and you will find sugar, and next time
you are asked what you have in your cart, tell the truth and
not lies.&rdquo; The cartman went home, and when he saw his
sugar was sugar once more, and no longer ashes, he was
very, very glad.</p>

<p>One of his brother-villagers thought, &ldquo;How pleasant it
would be to become a fak&iacute;r and do such things myself! I
will go to this fak&iacute;r and learn from him to be a fak&iacute;r too.&rdquo;
So he went after Shekh Far&iacute;d and found him walking along
the road, and he followed him. Now Shekh Far&iacute;d knew at
once what this man wanted, so as they passed a heap of
clay bricks, he said, &ldquo;O God, let it be thy pleasure to give
me power to turn these clay bricks into gold.&rdquo; Instantly
they became gold, and Shekh Far&iacute;d walked on; but the
villager took up two of the bricks and put one under each
arm, and then followed the fak&iacute;r. Suddenly Shekh Far&iacute;d
turned round, and said to him, &ldquo;You have two clay bricks
under your arms.&rdquo; The man looked, saw it was true, and
threw them away. Then Shekh Far&iacute;d said to him, &ldquo;You
steal bricks, and yet wish to be a fak&iacute;r?&rdquo; The man was
ashamed, and went back to his village.</p>

<p>Shekh Far&iacute;d continued his journey and got to H&aacute;m&aacute;ns&aacute;
R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s country; but when he got there he found Khel&aacute;par&iacute;
had gone to another country for a little while, so he never
saw her, nor found out how it was that she knew what happened
twenty miles off.</p>

<p>In a jungle in H&aacute;m&aacute;ns&aacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s country he met a man,
called Fak&iacute;r-achand, and his wife, who were very poor.
They were going to bury their only son, and were crying
bitterly. Shekh Far&iacute;d asked them, &ldquo;Would you like your
son to be alive again?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Will you give
him to me, and I will bring him to life, and then he shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
return to you?&rdquo; said Shekh Far&iacute;d. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they answered,
and gave him their dead son, and went to their home.</p>

<p>The fak&iacute;r carried the dead boy, who was called Mohand&aacute;s,
a little further on, and then laid him on the ground, and
struck him with a long thin bamboo wand he carried in
his hand. The boy stood up. Shekh Far&iacute;d asked him,
&ldquo;Would you like to go home to your father and mother, or
to stay with me?&rdquo; &ldquo;To stay with you,&rdquo; said Mohand&aacute;s.
(Had he wished to go home, the fak&iacute;r would have been very
angry.) &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Shekh Far&iacute;d, &ldquo;I will call your mother
here.&rdquo; He did so, and when she came, he said to her,
&ldquo;See, here is your son alive. Will you give him to me for
twelve years?&rdquo; The woman said, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and went home.
The fak&iacute;r gave her and her husband a quantity of rupees and
built them a beautiful house. Then he and Mohand&aacute;s set
out on their travels, and wandered about the jungles for
one whole year, till they came to a country full of large
splendid gardens belonging to a very rich R&aacute;j&aacute;, called
Dumk&aacute;s R&aacute;j&aacute;.</p>

<p>This R&aacute;j&aacute; had a beautiful daughter, Champ&aacute;k&aacute;l&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;.
She had lovely golden hair, golden eyebrows, golden eyelashes,
blue eyes, and her skin was transparent. In Dumk&aacute;s
R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s country they had never seen a fak&iacute;r, so when Shekh
Far&iacute;d and Mohand&aacute;s arrived, the R&aacute;j&aacute; sent to them, and
asked Shekh Far&iacute;d to come to talk to him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the
fak&iacute;r, &ldquo;I will not go to the R&aacute;j&aacute;: if the R&aacute;j&aacute; wants me, he
must come to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dumk&aacute;s R&aacute;j&aacute; was very angry when his messengers returned
with this answer, and he ordered Shekh Far&iacute;d to leave
his country immediately; but the fak&iacute;r said he would not go
until he had married his adopted son, Mohand&aacute;s, to Champ&aacute;k&aacute;l&iacute;
R&aacute;n&iacute;. The people all laughed at him for saying this,
and declared such a marriage would never take place.
However, the fak&iacute;r and Mohand&aacute;s walked about and saw the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
town, and looked at everything, and everybody stared at
them. Then they went to live on the border of Dumk&aacute;s
R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s country, and lived there for some time.</p>

<p>One day Shekh Far&iacute;d bought Mohand&aacute;s a beautiful horse
and fine clothes such as R&aacute;j&aacute;s wear, and told the boy to
ride about the fields and high roads. He also told him not
to speak to any one unless they spoke to him. Mohand&aacute;s
promised to do as he was bid. As he was riding along, he
met the Princess Champ&aacute;k&aacute;l&iacute;, who was also riding. She
asked him who he was. &ldquo;A R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What
R&aacute;j&aacute;?&rdquo; asked Champ&aacute;k&aacute;l&iacute;. &ldquo;Never mind what R&aacute;j&aacute;,&rdquo; said
Mohand&aacute;s. The princess then went home, and so did
Mohand&aacute;s; but every day after this they met and talked
together, and the princess fell very much in love with
Mohand&aacute;s.</p>

<p>At last she said to her father, &ldquo;I wish to marry a young
man who rides about on the border-land every day, and is
very handsome.&rdquo; The R&aacute;j&aacute; consented, for it was time his
daughter was married, and now no R&aacute;j&aacute; from another
country would come to marry her, as the demons who
guarded the princess swallowed all her suitors at one gulp,
and had already swallowed many R&aacute;j&aacute;s who had come on
this errand.</p>

<p>Shekh Far&iacute;d said to Mohand&aacute;s, &ldquo;Now go up to the palace,
and claim the princess for your wife.&rdquo; &ldquo;If I do,&rdquo; said
Mohand&aacute;s, &ldquo;the demons will swallow me.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will not let
them swallow you,&rdquo; said Shekh Far&iacute;d. So Mohand&aacute;s consented
and set off for the palace, Shekh Far&iacute;d following him.
When Mohand&aacute;s came to the demons, they were going to
swallow him; but the fak&iacute;r, who had his sword in his hand,
killed them all, and as he did so, the R&aacute;j&aacute;s and princes who
had come as suitors to the Princess Champ&aacute;k&aacute;l&iacute;, and had
therefore been swallowed by the demons, all came jumping
out of the demons&rsquo; stomachs and ran off in all directions as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
hard as they could, from fear not knowing where they
went.</p>

<p>Mohand&aacute;s was greatly frightened at all this; but Shekh
Far&iacute;d explained everything to him, so he went on to the
palace, and the fak&iacute;r went too. There Mohand&aacute;s asked
Dumk&aacute;s R&aacute;j&aacute; to give him his daughter as his wife, and the
R&aacute;j&aacute; consented. So he was married to Champ&aacute;k&aacute;l&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;,
and her father gave them a great many elephants, and horses,
and camels, and a great deal of money and many jewels.
And Mohand&aacute;s and his wife set off with the fak&iacute;r to his
father Fak&iacute;r-achand&rsquo;s house, and they took all the elephants,
camels, horses, money and jewels with them. On the way
Mohand&aacute;s told Champ&aacute;k&aacute;l&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; that he was not a great
R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son, but the son of poor people. Champ&aacute;k&aacute;l&iacute;&rsquo;s heart
was very sad at this; however, she was not angry, only
sorry.</p>

<p>When they reached H&aacute;m&aacute;ns&aacute; R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s country, and had
come to Fak&iacute;r-achand&rsquo;s house, the fak&iacute;r said to Mohand&aacute;s&rsquo;s
mother, &ldquo;See, you lent me one child, and I have brought
you back two children. Does this please you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed
it does please me,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I am very happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They built a beautiful palace and all lived in it together.
The mother begged Shekh Far&iacute;d to stay with them, saying,
&ldquo;Only stay with us; I will give you a bungalow, and you
shall have everything you want.&rdquo; But Shekh Far&iacute;d said, &ldquo;I
am a fak&iacute;r, and so cannot stay with you, as I may never stay
in one place, and must, instead, wander from country to
country and from jungle to jungle.&rdquo; So he said good-bye to
them and went on his wanderings, and never returned to
them.</p>

<p>Mohand&aacute;s, his wife, and his father and mother, all lived
happily together.</p>

<br />
THE MOUSE.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxvii">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapt"><span class="dcap">T</span></span>HERE was a mouse who wanted something to eat;
so he went to a garden, where many kinds of
grain, and fruit, and cabbages, and other vegetables
were growing. All round the garden the people to whom it
belonged had planted a hedge of thorns, that nothing might
get in. The mouse scrambled through the hedge, but great
thorns pierced his tail, and he began to cry. He came out
of the garden again through the hedge, and on his way
home he met a barber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must take out these thorns,&rdquo; said he to the barber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;without cutting off your tail
with my razor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind cutting off my tail,&rdquo; said the mouse.</p>

<p>The barber cut off the mouse&rsquo;s tail. But the mouse was
in a rage. He seized the razor and ran away with it. At
this the poor barber was very unhappy and began to cry, for
he had no pice wherewith to buy another.</p>

<p>The mouse ran on and on until at last he came to another
country, in which there were no knives or sickles to cut the
grass with. There the mouse saw a man pulling the grass
out of the ground with his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will cut your hands,&rdquo; said the mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are no knives here,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;so I must
pull up the grass in this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must take my razor then,&rdquo; said the mouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
&ldquo;Suppose your razor should break? I could not buy you
another,&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind if it does break,&rdquo; said the mouse, &ldquo;I give
it to you as a present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the man took the razor and began cutting the grass,
and as he was cutting, the razor broke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, why have you broken my razor?&rdquo; exclaimed the
mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did not I tell you it would break?&rdquo; answered the man.</p>

<p>The mouse snatched up the man&rsquo;s blanket and ran off
with it. The grass-cutter began to cry. &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;The mouse has carried away my blanket, and I
have not money wherewith to buy another.&rdquo; And he went
home very sad.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the mouse ran on and on until he arrived at
another country, where he saw a grain merchant chopping up
sugar-canes; only as he had no blanket or cloth to lay the
canes on, he chopped them up on the ground, and so they
got dirty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you chop up your canes on the ground?&rdquo; said
the mouse; &ldquo;they all get dirty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; answered the man. &ldquo;I have no pice
wherewith to buy a blanket to chop them on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you take mine?&rdquo; said the mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I took yours it would get cut, and I have no money
to buy you another,&rdquo; said the grain merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind; I don&rsquo;t want another,&rdquo; said the mouse.</p>

<p>So the man took the blanket, and of course he cut it.
When he had finished chopping up his sugar-canes, he gave
it back to the mouse.</p>

<p>When the mouse saw the blanket was full of holes, he was
very angry indeed with the man, and seizing all the sugar-canes
he ran away with them as fast as he could. The grain
merchant began to cry. &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
have no more sugar-canes.&rdquo; And he went home very
sorrowful.</p>

<p>Then the mouse ran on and on till he came to another
country, where he stopped at a sweetmeat-seller&rsquo;s shop.
Now in this country there was no salt and no sugar. And
the sweetmeat-seller made his sweetmeats of flour and ghee
without either sugar or salt, so that they were very nasty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you give me some sweetmeats for a pice?&rdquo; said
the mouse to the sweetmeat-seller. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the
man, and he gave one. The mouse began to eat it and
thought it very nasty indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, there is no sugar in it!&rdquo; exclaimed the mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;we have no sugar in this country.
The few sugar-canes we have are so dear, that poor people
like myself cannot buy them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then take my sugar-canes,&rdquo; cried the mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Where should I find the money
to pay you for them? They would be all used in making
sweetmeats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take them,&rdquo; said the mouse; &ldquo;I give them to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sweetmeat-seller took them and began making sweetmeats
of all kinds, so that he used all the sugar-canes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why have you used all my sugar-canes?&rdquo; cried the mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did not I tell you I should do so?&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a thief!&rdquo; cried the mouse, and he knocked
down the sweetmeat-seller, seized all his sweetmeats, and ran
off with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do now?&rdquo; cried the sweetmeat-seller. &ldquo;I
have no money to buy flour and ghee to make more sweetmeats
with; and if I quarrel with the mouse, he will doubtless
kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the mouse ran on and on till he reached a
country, the R&aacute;j&aacute; of which had a great many cows&mdash;hundreds
of cows. The mouse stopped at the pasture-ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
of these cows. Now, the cowherds were so poor they could
not buy bread every day, and sometimes they ate bread which
was twelve days old. When the mouse arrived, the cowherds
were eating their bread, and it was very stale and mouldy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you eat that stale bread?&rdquo; said the mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we have no money to buy any other with,&rdquo;
answered the cowherds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at all these sweetmeats,&rdquo; said the mouse. &ldquo;Take
them and eat them instead of that stale bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if we eat them, we must pay you for them, and
where shall we get the money?&rdquo; said the cowherds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind the money,&rdquo; said the mouse.</p>

<p>So the cowherds took the sweetmeats and ate them all
up. At this the mouse was furious. He stuck a pole into
the ground, and ran and fetched ropes, and tied the cowherds
hand and foot to the pole. Then he took all the cows
and ran off with them.</p>

<p>He ran on and on till he got to a country where there
were no fowls, no cows, no buffaloes, no meat of any kind;
and the people in it did not even know what milk and
meat were. The day the mouse arrived was the day the
R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s daughter was to be married, and a great many people
were assembled together. The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s cooks were cooking,
but they had neither meat nor ghee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are all these people assembled together?&rdquo; said the
mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day is our R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s wedding-day, and we are
cooking the dinner,&rdquo; answered the cooks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have no meat,&rdquo; said the mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the cooks. &ldquo;There is no meat of any kind
in our country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my cows,&rdquo; said the mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the cooks; &ldquo;our R&aacute;j&aacute; could not pay for them;
he is too poor.&rdquo; (He was only a petty R&aacute;j&aacute;.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
&ldquo;It does not matter,&rdquo; said the mouse. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the cooks took the cows and the sheep and killed them,
and dressed their flesh in different ways; made pilaus
and curries; they roasted some and boiled some, and gave
it to the people to eat. In this way they made an end of all
the cows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why have you made an end of all my cows?&rdquo; cried the
mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did not we tell you we should make use of them all?&rdquo;
said the cooks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me my cows,&rdquo; said the mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t. The people have eaten them all up,&rdquo; said
the cooks.</p>

<p>The mouse was in a great rage. He ran off to the bridegroom,
who was walking near the kitchen, saying to himself,
&ldquo;Now I will go and fetch my bride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me the money for my cows,&rdquo; cried the mouse to
him. &ldquo;Your people have eaten them all up, and your cooks
won&rsquo;t pay me, so you must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have I to do with your cows?&rdquo; said the bridegroom.
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t pay you for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then if you won&rsquo;t pay me, your wife&rsquo;s father must,&rdquo; said
the mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>he</em> is too poor to pay for your cows,&rdquo; said the bridegroom,
&ldquo;and I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then if I am not paid, I will take away your bride,&rdquo; said
the mouse; and he ran off and carried away the bride.</p>

<p>The R&aacute;j&aacute; was very angry at this; but the mouse ran on
and on with his wife (so he called the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s daughter) till
he came to another country.</p>

<p>Now, on the day he arrived in it there were going to be
grand sights and fun to please its R&aacute;j&aacute;. Some jugglers and
rope-dancers were going to perform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
&ldquo;Take my wife and let her walk on the rope; she is young,
and your wives are old,&rdquo; said the mouse to the rope-dancers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;for she does not know how to
walk on a rope and carry at the same time a wooden plate
on her head. She would fall and break her neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must take my wife,&rdquo; said the mouse. &ldquo;She
won&rsquo;t fall; she is young, and your wives are old. You really
must take her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the rope-dancers took her, much against their will, and
when she began to walk on the rope with the wooden plate
on her head, she fell and died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, why have you killed my wife?&rdquo; cried the mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did we not tell you she would fall and kill herself?&rdquo;
answered the rope-dancers.</p>

<p>The mouse seized all the jugglers&rsquo; and rope-dancers&rsquo; wives,
and the things they used in dancing and juggling, and ran
off with them. Then the rope-dancers and jugglers began
to cry, and said, &ldquo;What shall we do? Our wives and our
property are all gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the mouse ran on and on until he came to
another country, where he got a house to live in. And he
ate a great deal, and grew so fat that he could not get through
the door of his house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send for a carpenter,&rdquo; said he to the rope-dancers&rsquo; and
jugglers&rsquo; wives, &ldquo;and tell him to cut off some of my flesh.
Then I shall be able to get into my house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The women sent for a carpenter, and when he came the
mouse said to him, &ldquo;cut off some of my flesh, then I shall
be able to go into my house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I do,&rdquo; said the carpenter, &ldquo;you will die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t die,&rdquo; said the mouse. &ldquo;Do as I bid
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the carpenter took his knife, and cut off some of the
mouse&rsquo;s flesh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, dear! oh, dear!&rdquo; cried the mouse; &ldquo;how it does
hurt! What can I do to make it stop paining me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must go to a certain place, where a particular kind
of grain grows, and rub the grain on your wounds. Then
they will get quite well,&rdquo; said the carpenter.</p>

<p>So the mouse ran off to the place to which the carpenter
had told him to go, and rubbed his wounds with the grain.
This gave him such pain that he fell down and died.</p>

<p>The rope-dancers&rsquo; and jugglers&rsquo; wives went home to their
husbands with all the things the mouse had carried away,
and they all lived happily ever after.</p>

A WONDERFUL STORY.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxviii">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapo"><span class="dcap">O</span></span>NCE there lived two wrestlers, who were both very
very strong. The stronger of the two had a daughter
called Aj&iacute;t; the other had no daughter at all.
These wrestlers did not live in the same country, but their
two villages were not far apart.</p>

<p>One day the wrestler that had no daughter heard of the
wrestler that had a daughter, and he determined to go and
find him and wrestle with him, to see who was the stronger.
He went therefore to Aj&iacute;t&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s country, and when he
arrived at his house, he knocked at the door and said, &ldquo;Is
any one here?&rdquo; Aj&iacute;t answered, &ldquo;Yes, I am here;&rdquo; and
she came out. &ldquo;Where is the wrestler who lives in this
house?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; answered Aj&iacute;t, &ldquo;has
taken three hundred carts to the jungle, and he is drawing
them himself, as he could not get enough bullocks and
horses to pull them along. He is gone to get wood.&rdquo; This
astonished the wrestler very much. &ldquo;Your father must
indeed be very strong,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Then he set off to the jungle, and in the jungle he found
two dead elephants. He tied them to the two ends of a
pole, took the pole on his shoulder, and returned to Aj&iacute;t&rsquo;s
house. There he knocked at the door, crying, &ldquo;Is any one
here?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I am here,&rdquo; said Aj&iacute;t. &ldquo;Has your father come
back?&rdquo; asked the wrestler. &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Aj&iacute;t, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
was busy sweeping the room. Now, her father had twelve
elephants. Eleven were in the stables, but one was lying
dead in the room Aj&iacute;t was sweeping; and as she swept, she
swept the dead elephant without any trouble out of the
door. This frightened the wrestler. &ldquo;What a strong girl
this is!&rdquo; he said to himself. When Aj&iacute;t had swept all the
dust out of the room, she came and gathered it and the
dead elephant up, and threw dust and elephant away. The
wrestler was more and more astonished.</p>

<p>He set off again to find Aj&iacute;t&rsquo;s father, and met him pulling
the three hundred carts along. At this he was still more
alarmed, but he said to him, &ldquo;Will you wrestle with me
now?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Aj&iacute;t&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t; for here there is
no one to see us.&rdquo; The other again begged him to wrestle
at once, and at that moment an old woman bent with age
came by. She was carrying bread to her son, who had taken
his mother&rsquo;s three or four thousand camels to browse.</p>

<p>The first wrestler called to her at once, &ldquo;Come and see us
wrestle.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;for I must take my
son his dinner. He is very hungry.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no; you must
stay and see us wrestle,&rdquo; cried both the wrestlers. &ldquo;I cannot
stay,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but do one of you stand on one of my
hands, and the other on the other, and then you can wrestle
as we go along.&rdquo; &ldquo;You carry us!&rdquo; cried the men. &ldquo;You
are so old, you will never be able to carry us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed I
shall,&rdquo; said the old woman. So they got up on her hands,
and she rested her hands, with the wrestlers standing on them,
on her shoulders; and her son&rsquo;s flour-cakes she put on her
head. Thus they went on their way, and the men wrestled
as they went.</p>

<p>Now the old woman had told her son that if he did not
do his work well, she would bring men to kill him; so he
was dreadfully frightened when he saw his mother coming
with the wrestlers. &ldquo;Here is my mother coming to kill me,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
he said: and he tied up the three or four thousand camels in
his cloth, put them all on his head, and ran off with them as
fast as he could. &ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo; cried his mother, when she
saw him running away. But he only ran on still faster, and
the old woman and the wrestlers ran after him.</p>

<p>Just then a kite was flying about, and the kite said to itself,
&ldquo;There must be some meat in that man&rsquo;s cloth,&rdquo; so it swept
down and carried off the bundle of camels. The old
woman&rsquo;s son at this sat down and cried.</p>

<p>The wrestlers soon came up to him and said, &ldquo;What are
you crying for?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; answered the boy, &ldquo;my mother
said that if I did not do my work, she would bring men to
kill me. So, when I saw you coming with her, I tied all the
camels up in my cloth, put them on my head, and ran off.
A kite came down and carried them all away. That is why
I am crying.&rdquo; The wrestlers were much astonished at the
boy&rsquo;s strength and at the kite&rsquo;s strength, and they all three
set off in the direction in which the kite had flown.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the kite had flown on and on till it had reached
another country, and the daughter of the R&aacute;j&aacute; of this country
was sitting on the roof of the palace, combing her long
black hair. The princess looked up at the kite and the
bundle, and said, &ldquo;There must be meat in that bundle.&rdquo; At
that moment the kite let the bundle of camels fall, and it fell
into the princess&rsquo;s eye, and went deep into it; but her eye was
so large that it did not hurt her much. &ldquo;Oh, mother!
mother!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;something has fallen into my eye! come
and take it out.&rdquo; Her mother rushed up, took the bundle
of camels out of the princess&rsquo;s eye, and shoved the bundle
into her pocket.</p>

<p>The wrestlers and the old woman&rsquo;s son now came up,
having seen all that had happened. &ldquo;Where is the bundle
of camels?&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;and why do you cry?&rdquo; they asked
the princess. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;she is crying because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
something fell into her eye.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was the bundle of camels
that fell into her eye, and the bundle is in your pocket,&rdquo; said
the old woman&rsquo;s son to the R&aacute;n&iacute;: and he put his hand into
her pocket and pulled out the bundle. Then he and the
wrestlers went back to Aj&iacute;t&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s house, and on the
way they met his old mother, who went with them.</p>

<p>They invited a great many people to dinner, and Aj&iacute;t took
a large quantity of flour and made it into flat cakes. Then
she handed a cake to the wrestler who had come to see her
father, and gave one to everybody else. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat such
a big cake as this,&rdquo; said the wrestler. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said
Aj&iacute;t. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t indeed,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;it is much too
big.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then I will eat it myself,&rdquo; said Aj&iacute;t, and taking it
and all the other cakes she popped them into her mouth together.
&ldquo;That is not half enough for me,&rdquo; she said. Then
she offered him a can of water. &ldquo;I cannot drink all that
water,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Aj&iacute;t; &ldquo;I can drink
much more than that.&rdquo; So she filled a large tub with water,
lifted it to her mouth, and drank it all up at a draught.</p>

<p>The wrestler was very much astonished, and said to her,
&ldquo;Will you come to my house? I will give you a dinner.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You will never be able to give me enough to eat and drink,&rdquo;
said Aj&iacute;t. &ldquo;Yes, I shall,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You will not be able
to give me enough, I am sure,&rdquo; said Aj&iacute;t; &ldquo;I cannot come.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I will
come; but I know you will never be able to give me enough
food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they set off to his house. But when they had gone a
little way, she said, &ldquo;I must have my house with me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I cannot carry your house,&rdquo; said the wrestler. &ldquo;You must,&rdquo;
said Aj&iacute;t, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t, I cannot go with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I
cannot carry your house,&rdquo; said the wrestler. &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo;
said Aj&iacute;t, &ldquo;I will carry it myself.&rdquo; So she went back, dug
up her house, and hoisted it on her head. This frightened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
the wrestler. &ldquo;What a strong woman she must be!&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;I will not wrestle with her father; for if I do, he
will kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they all went on till they came to his house. When
they got to it, Aj&iacute;t set her house down on the ground, and
the wrestler went to get the dinner he had promised her. He
brought quantities of things&mdash;all sorts of things&mdash;everything
he could think of. Three kinds of flour, milk, dhall, rice,
curries, and meat. Then he showed them all to Aj&iacute;t. &ldquo;That
is not enough for my dinner,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why, that would
be hardly enough for my mice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wrestler wondered very much at this, and asked, &ldquo;Are
your mice so very big?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, they are very big,&rdquo; she
answered; &ldquo;come and see.&rdquo; So he took up all the food he
had brought, and laid it on the floor of Aj&iacute;t&rsquo;s house. Then
at once all the mice came and ate it up every bit. The
wrestler was greatly surprised; and Aj&iacute;t said, &ldquo;Did I not
tell you true? and did I not tell you, you would never be able
to get me enough to eat?&rdquo; &ldquo;Come to the Nabha R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s
country,&rdquo; said the wrestler. &ldquo;There you will surely get
enough to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this she agreed; so she, her father, and the wrestler
went off to the Nabha R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s country. &ldquo;I have brought a
very strong girl,&rdquo; said the wrestler to the Nabha R&aacute;j&aacute;. &ldquo;I
will try her strength,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute;. &ldquo;Give me three
elephants,&rdquo; said Aj&iacute;t, &ldquo;and I will carry them for you.&rdquo; Then
the R&aacute;j&aacute; sent for three elephants, and said to her, &ldquo;Now,
carry these.&rdquo; &ldquo;Give me a rope,&rdquo; said Aj&iacute;t. So they gave
her a rope, and she tied the three elephants together, and
flung them over her shoulder. &ldquo;Now, where shall I throw
them?&rdquo; she said to the astonished R&aacute;j&aacute;. &ldquo;Shall I throw
them on to the roof of your palace? or on to the ground?
or away out there?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute;.
&ldquo;Throw them upon my roof.&rdquo; She threw the elephants up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
on to the roof with such force that it broke, and the elephants
fell through into the palace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; cried the R&aacute;j&aacute;. &ldquo;It is not my
fault,&rdquo; answered Aj&iacute;t. &ldquo;You told me to throw the elephants
on to your roof, and so I did.&rdquo; Then the R&aacute;j&aacute; sent for a
great many men and bullocks and horses to pull the elephants
out of his palace. But they could not the first time
they pulled; then they tried a second time and succeeded,
and they threw the elephants away.</p>

<p>Then Aj&iacute;t went home. &ldquo;What shall I do with this dreadful
woman?&rdquo; said the Nabha R&aacute;j&aacute;. &ldquo;She is sure to kill
me, and take all my country. I will try to kill her.&rdquo; So he
got his sepoys and guns into order, and went out to kill Aj&iacute;t.
She was looking out of her window, and saw them coming.
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;here is the Nabha R&aacute;j&aacute; coming to kill me.&rdquo;
Then she went out of her house and asked him why he had
come. &ldquo;To kill you,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute;. &ldquo;Is that what you
want to do?&rdquo; she said; and with one hand she took up the
R&aacute;j&aacute;, his guns, and his sepoys, and put them all under her
arm: and she carried them all off to the Nabha R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s
country. There she put the R&aacute;j&aacute; into prison, and made herself
R&aacute;n&iacute; of his kingdom. She was very much pleased at
being R&aacute;n&iacute; of the Nabha country; for it was a rich country,
and there were quantities of fruits and of corn in it. And
she lived happily for a long, long time.</p>

THE FAK&Iacute;R N&Aacute;NAKS&Aacute; SAVES THE
MERCHANT&rsquo;S LIFE.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxix">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapi"><span class="dcap">I</span></span>N a country there was a grain merchant who was a
very good man. Now a fak&iacute;r named N&aacute;naks&aacute;,
who was also a very good man, came constantly
to talk with him.</p>

<p>One day he came as usual, and the merchant and his
wife were very glad to see him. As they were all sitting
together, they saw a goat led away to be killed. The goat
escaped from the man who was leading him and hid behind
the merchant, but he was caught and marched off to death.</p>

<p>At this the merchant said nothing, but the fak&iacute;r laughed.</p>

<p>A little later they saw an old woman who had done something
wrong, and, therefore, the king had ordered her to be
taken to the jungle and there put to death. The old woman
escaped from the men who were leading her and took refuge
behind the merchant, but she was seized and led away to
die.</p>

<p>The merchant said nothing; the fak&iacute;r laughed, and the
merchant&rsquo;s wife saw him laugh.</p>

<p>At this moment the merchant&rsquo;s little daughter woke and
began to scream. Her mother took her in her arms; the
child was cross and pulled her mother&rsquo;s clothes all awry.</p>

<p>The fak&iacute;r laughed.</p>

<p>The mother put her dress straight and held her child in
her arms and stopped her crying. She then took a knife
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
and went up to the fak&iacute;r, saying, &ldquo;Why did you laugh three
times? Tell me the truth. What made you laugh three
times?&rdquo; N&aacute;naks&aacute; answered, &ldquo;What does it signify whether
I cry or laugh? Ask me no questions, for I am a fak&iacute;r,
and it does not matter in the least whether I laugh or cry.&rdquo;
However, the merchant&rsquo;s wife insisted on knowing why he
laughed, and she said, &ldquo;If you do not tell me, I will kill
you with my knife.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said N&aacute;naks&aacute;; &ldquo;if you really
do wish to know, I will tell you.&rdquo; &ldquo;I really do wish to
know,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said N&aacute;naks&aacute;, &ldquo;you remember the goat took refuge
behind your husband? That goat in his former life was
your husband&rsquo;s father, and your husband would have saved
him from death had he given the man who was taking him
to be killed four rupees, for the man would then have gone
away contentedly without the goat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;Why did you laugh the
second time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said N&aacute;naks&aacute;, &ldquo;that old woman who hid herself
behind your husband was his grandmother in her former life.
Had your husband given the men who were taking her to the
jungle twenty rupees, they would have given her up to him,
and he would have saved her from death. Should a wild
beast or a man ever take refuge behind us, it is our duty to
save his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the merchant&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;you have told me why
you laughed the first two times. Now tell me why you
laughed the third time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said N&aacute;naks&aacute;. &ldquo;You remember your husband&rsquo;s
sister whom you tormented so much? She died, but then
God caused her to be born again as your daughter, that she
might torment you and punish you for having been so
unkind to her in her former life when she was your sister-in-law.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; said the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; answered the fak&iacute;r, &ldquo;and that is why I
laughed the third time. But now would you like to hear
something I wish to tell you? If you promise not to cry, I
will tell it you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise not to cry, so tell me,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then listen,&rdquo; said N&aacute;naks&aacute;. &ldquo;God has decreed that
your husband shall die to-morrow morning at ten o&rsquo;clock.
He will send four angels to fetch him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the poor woman began to cry bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not cry,&rdquo; said the fak&iacute;r. &ldquo;I will tell you something
more. Listen to me. To-morrow morning at four o&rsquo;clock
you must get up, and make your house quite clean and neat.
Then buy new dishes and make all the nicest and most
delicious sweetmeats you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>When it was yet night she rose, and did all the fak&iacute;r had
bidden her. Then she went to him and said, &ldquo;The sweetmeats
are ready.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said N&aacute;naks&aacute;, &ldquo;go and get a
fine, clean cloth; take it and the sweetmeats with you, and
set out and walk on and on till you come to a plain which
is a long way from this. But you must go on till you reach
it, and on it you will see a tank and a tree. By the tank and
the tree you must spread your cloth and lay out your sweetmeats
on it. At nine o&rsquo;clock you will see four men, who
will come and bathe in the tank. When they have bathed
they will come towards you, and you must say to them,
&lsquo;See! you are four angels, therefore you must eat some of
my sweetmeats.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman set out for the plain and did all N&aacute;naks&aacute; had
told her to do; and everything happened as he had foretold.
When the four men had bathed, they came towards the
woman, and she said to them, &ldquo;See! you are four angels,
and therefore you must eat some of my sweetmeats.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
The chief of the four angels, who was called Jabr&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;l, and
the three other angels answered, &ldquo;We have no money,
wherewith to buy your sweetmeats, so how can we eat
any of them?&rdquo; &ldquo;Never mind the money,&rdquo; said the woman;
&ldquo;you can pay me another day. Come now and eat some.&rdquo;
So the four angels sat down and ate a great many of her
sweetmeats.</p>

<p>When they had finished they stood up and said to each
other, &ldquo;Now we must go to the village and fetch the
merchant.&rdquo; Then the woman made them a great many
salaams and said, &ldquo;That merchant is my husband.
Still, if it is your pleasure to take him away, take him
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the angels were sad, and said to her, &ldquo;How can
we take your husband&rsquo;s life now that we have eaten your
food? But stay under this tree till we return, and then we
will pay you for your sweetmeats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the angels left her, and the wife waited under the tree.
She was very sad; and after some time she thought, &ldquo;Now
I will go home: perhaps these angels are gone to take his
life;&rdquo; and then she cried bitterly and remained under the
tree.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the four angels had gone back to God, who
asked them, &ldquo;Have you brought the merchant?&rdquo; They
were sorry not to have brought him, and told God all that
had happened. And God was very angry; but he said to
them. &ldquo;Never mind. I know the fak&iacute;r N&aacute;naks&aacute; is with the
merchant and his wife just now, and it is he who has played
you this trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then God wrote a letter in which he promised the merchant
twenty years more life, only at the end of the twenty
years he was really to die and not to be allowed to live any
longer. This letter he gave to the angels, and bade them
take it to the merchant&rsquo;s wife and tell her to have a silver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
box made, into which she was to put the letter, and then
hang it round her husband&rsquo;s neck, so that he should live
for twenty years more.</p>

<p>The four angels came down to earth again, and went to
the tree under which they had left the woman. They found
her waiting for them, and gave her the letter saying, &ldquo;You
must get a silver box made and put this letter in it; then
hang it round your husband&rsquo;s neck, so that he may live for
twenty years more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman thanked them, and was very happy. She
took the letter and went home. There she found her husband
quite well, and with him was N&aacute;naks&aacute;. She gave
N&aacute;naks&aacute; the letter and told him what the angels had bidden
her do with it. N&aacute;naks&aacute; read the letter, and was very much
pleased. Then he said to her, &ldquo;Call a silversmith here,
and let him make you the silver box. Then you must get
a great dinner ready, and ask all your friends, rich and
poor, to come and eat it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this she did, and when the dinner was ready and all
their friends had come, the fak&iacute;r said, &ldquo;None who are here,
men, women, or children, must eat, till they have put their
hands before their faces and worshipped God.&rdquo; Everybody
hid his face in his hands at once and worshipped God:
while they did this the fak&iacute;r stole away from them, so when
they uncovered their faces he was nowhere to be seen. No
one knew where he had gone, and no one had seen him go.
Some of the men went to look for him, but they could not
find him, and none of them ever saw him again.</p>

<p>But the merchant and his wife lived happily together.</p>

THE BOY WHO HAD A MOON ON HIS FOREHEAD
AND A STAR ON HIS CHIN.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxx">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapi"><span class="dcap">I</span></span>N a country were seven daughters of poor parents,
who used to come daily to play under the shady
trees in the King&rsquo;s garden with the gardener&rsquo;s
daughter; and daily she used to say to them, &ldquo;When I am
married I shall have a son. Such a beautiful boy as he will
be has never been seen. He will have a moon on his forehead,
and a star on his chin.&rdquo; Then her playfellows used
to laugh at her and mock her.</p>

<p>But one day the King heard her telling them about the
beautiful boy she would have when she was married, and he
said to himself he should like very much to have such a son;
the more so that though he had already four wives he had
no child. He went, therefore, to the gardener and told him
he wished to marry his daughter. This delighted the gardener
and his wife, who thought it would indeed be grand for their
daughter to become a princess. So they said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the
King, and invited all their friends to the wedding. The
King invited all his, and he gave the gardener as much
money as he wanted. Then the wedding was held with
great feasting and rejoicing.</p>

<p>A year later the day drew near on which the gardener&rsquo;s
daughter was to have her son; and the King&rsquo;s four other
wives came constantly to see her. One day they said to her,
&ldquo;The King hunts every day; and the time is soon coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
when you will have your child. Suppose you fell ill whilst
he was out hunting and could therefore know nothing of
your illness, what would you do then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the King came home that evening, the gardener&rsquo;s
daughter said to him, &ldquo;Every day you go out hunting.
Should I ever be in trouble or sick while you are away, how
could I send for you?&rdquo; The King gave her a kettle-drum
which he placed near the door for her, and he said to her,
&ldquo;Whenever you want me, beat this kettle-drum. No matter
how far away I may be, I shall hear it, and will come at once
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next morning, when the King had gone out to hunt, his
four other wives came to see the gardener&rsquo;s daughter. She
told them all about her kettle-drum. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;do
drum on it just to see if the King really will come to you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, I will not,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;for why should I call him from
his hunting when I do not want him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind interrupting
his hunting,&rdquo; they answered. &ldquo;Do try if he really
will come to you when you beat your kettle-drum.&rdquo; So at last,
just to please them, she beat it, and the King stood before her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why have you called me?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;See, I have left
my hunting to come to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;I want nothing,&rdquo; she
answered; &ldquo;I only wished to know if you really would come
to me when I beat my drum.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered the
King; &ldquo;but do not call me again unless you really need
me.&rdquo; Then he returned to his hunting.</p>

<p>The next day, when the King had gone out hunting as
usual, the four wives again came to see the gardener&rsquo;s daughter.
They begged and begged her to beat her drum once
more, &ldquo;just to see if the King will really come to see you
this time.&rdquo; At first she refused, but at last she consented.
So she beat her drum, and the King came to her. But when
he found she was neither ill nor in trouble, he was angry,
and said to her, &ldquo;Twice I have left my hunting and lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
my game to come to you when you did not need me. Now
you may call me as much as you like, but I will not come
to you,&rdquo; and then he went away in a rage.</p>

<p>The third day the gardener&rsquo;s daughter fell ill, and she beat
and beat her kettle-drum; but the King never came. He
heard her kettle-drum, but he thought, &ldquo;She does not really
want me; she is only trying to see if I will go to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the four other wives came to her, and they
said, &ldquo;Here it is the custom before a child is born to bind
its mother&rsquo;s eyes with a handkerchief that she may not see
it just at first. So let us bind your eyes.&rdquo; She answered,
&ldquo;Very well, bind my eyes.&rdquo; The four wives then tied a
handkerchief over them.</p>

<p>Soon after, the gardener&rsquo;s daughter had a beautiful little
son, with a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin;
and before the poor mother had seen him, the four wicked
wives took the boy to the nurse and said to her, &ldquo;Now you
must not let this child make the least sound for fear his
mother should hear him; and in the night you must either
kill him, or else take him away, so that his mother may
never see him. If you obey our orders, we will give you a
great many rupees.&rdquo; All this they did out of spite. The
nurse took the little child and put him into a box, and the
four wives went back to the gardener&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>First they put a stone into her boy&rsquo;s little bed, and then
they took the handkerchief off her eyes and showed it her,
saying, &ldquo;Look! this is your son!&rdquo; The poor girl cried
bitterly, and thought, &ldquo;What will the King say when he
finds no child?&rdquo; But she could do nothing.</p>

<p>When the King came home, he was furious at hearing his
youngest wife, the gardener&rsquo;s daughter, had given him a
stone instead of the beautiful little son she had promised
him. He made her one of the palace servants, and never
spoke to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
In the middle of the night the nurse took the box in
which was the beautiful little prince, and went out to a broad
plain in the jungle. There she dug a hole, made the fastenings
of the box sure, and put the box into the hole, although
the child in it was still alive. The King&rsquo;s dog, whose name
was Shankar, had followed her to see what she did with the
box. As soon as she had gone back to the four wives (who
gave her a great many rupees), the dog went to the hole in
which she had put the box, took the box out, and opened it.
When he saw the beautiful little boy, he was very much delighted
and said, &ldquo;If it pleases God that this child should
live, I will not hurt him; I will not eat him, but I will swallow
him whole and hide him in my stomach.&rdquo; This he did.</p>

<p>After six months had passed, the dog went by night to the
jungle, and thought, &ldquo;I wonder whether the boy is alive or
dead.&rdquo; Then he brought the child out of his stomach and
rejoiced over his beauty. The boy was now six months old.
When Shankar had caressed and loved him, he swallowed
him again for another six months. At the end of that time
he went once more by night to the broad jungle-plain. There
he brought up the child out of his stomach (the child was
now a year old), and caressed and petted him a great deal,
and was made very happy by his great beauty.</p>

<p>But this time the dog&rsquo;s keeper had followed and watched
the dog; and he saw all that Shankar did, and the beautiful
little child, so he ran to the four wives and said to them,
&ldquo;Inside the King&rsquo;s dog there is a child! the loveliest child!
He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.
Such a child has never been seen!&rdquo; At this the four wives
were very much frightened, and as soon as the King came
home from hunting they said to him, &ldquo;While you were
away your dog came to our rooms, and tore our clothes
and knocked about all our things. We are afraid he will
kill us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not be afraid,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;Eat your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
dinner and be happy. I will have the dog shot to-morrow
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he ordered his servants to shoot the dog at dawn,
but the dog heard him, and said to himself, &ldquo;What shall I
do? The King intends to kill me. I don&rsquo;t care about that,
but what will become of the child if I am killed? He will
die. But I will see if I cannot save him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So when it was night, the dog ran to the King&rsquo;s cow, who
was called Sur&iacute;, and said to her, &ldquo;Sur&iacute;, I want to give you
something, for the King has ordered me to be shot to-morrow.
Will you take great care of whatever I give you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Let me see what it is,&rdquo; said Sur&iacute;; &ldquo;I will take care of it if
I can.&rdquo; Then they both went together to the wide plain,
and there the dog brought up the boy. Sur&iacute; was enchanted
with him. &ldquo;I never saw such a beautiful child in this
country,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;See, he has a moon on his forehead
and a star on his chin. I will take the greatest care of him.&rdquo;
So saying she swallowed the little prince. The dog made
her a great many salaams, and said, &ldquo;To-morrow I shall
die;&rdquo; and the cow then went back to her stable.</p>

<p>Next morning at dawn the dog was taken to the jungle
and shot.</p>

<p>The child now lived in Sur&iacute;&rsquo;s stomach; and when one
whole year had passed, and he was two years old, the cow
went out to the plain, and said to herself, &ldquo;I do not know
whether the child is alive or dead. But I have never hurt
it, so I will see.&rdquo; Then she brought up the boy; and he
played about, and Sur&iacute; was delighted; she loved him and
caressed him, and talked to him. Then she swallowed him,
and returned to her stable.</p>

<p>At the end of another year she went again to the plain
and brought up the child. He played and ran about for an
hour to her great delight, and she talked to him and caressed
him. His great beauty made her very happy. Then she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
swallowed him once more and returned to her stable. The
child was now three years old.</p>

<p>But this time the cowherd had followed Sur&iacute;, and had seen
the wonderful child and all she did to it. So he ran and
told the four wives, &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s cow has a beautiful boy
inside her. He has a moon on his forehead and a star on
his chin. Such a child has never been seen before!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the wives were terrified. They tore their clothes
and their hair and cried. When the King came home at
evening, he asked them why they were so agitated. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
they said, &ldquo;your cow came and tried to kill us; but we ran
away. She tore our hair and our clothes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo;
said the King. &ldquo;Eat your dinner and be happy. The cow
shall be killed to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Sur&iacute; heard the King give this order to the servants,
so she said to herself, &ldquo;What shall I do to save the child?&rdquo;
When it was midnight, she went to the King&rsquo;s horse called
Katar, who was very wicked, and quite untameable. No one
had ever been able to ride him; indeed no one could go
near him with safety, he was so savage. Sur&iacute; said to this
horse, &ldquo;Katar, will you take care of something that I want
to give you, because the King has ordered me to be killed
to-morrow?&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Katar; &ldquo;show me what it is.&rdquo;
Then Sur&iacute; brought up the child, and the horse was delighted
with him. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will take the greatest care of
him. Till now no one has been able to ride me, but this
child shall ride me.&rdquo; Then he swallowed the boy, and when
he had done so, the cow made him many salaams, saying,
&ldquo;It is for this boy&rsquo;s sake that I am to die.&rdquo; The next
morning she was taken to the jungle and there killed.</p>

<p>The beautiful boy now lived in the horse&rsquo;s stomach, and
he stayed in it for one whole year. At the end of that
time the horse thought, &ldquo;I will see if this child is alive or
dead.&rdquo; So he brought him up; and then he loved him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
and petted him, and the little prince played all about the
stable, out of which the horse was never allowed to go.
Katar was very glad to see the child, who was now four years
old. After he had played for some time, the horse swallowed
him again. At the end of another year, when the boy was
five years old, Katar brought him up again, caressed him,
loved him, and let him play about the stable as he had done
a year before. Then the horse swallowed him again.</p>

<p>But this time the groom had seen all that happened, and
when it was morning, and the King had gone away to his
hunting, he went to the four wicked wives, and told them all
he had seen, and all about the wonderful, beautiful child that
lived inside the King&rsquo;s horse Katar. On hearing the groom&rsquo;s
story the four wives cried, and tore their hair and clothes, and
refused to eat. When the King returned at evening and
asked them why they were so miserable, they said, &ldquo;Your
horse Katar came and tore our clothes, and upset all our
things, and we ran away for fear he should kill us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never
mind,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;Only eat your dinner and be happy.
I will have Katar shot to-morrow.&rdquo; Then he thought that
two men unaided could not kill such a wicked horse, so he
ordered his servants to bid his troop of sepoys shoot him.</p>

<p>So the next day the King placed his sepoys all round the
stable, and he took up his stand with them; and he said he
would himself shoot any one who let his horse escape.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the horse had overheard all these orders. So
he brought up the child and said to him, &ldquo;Go into that little
room that leads out of the stable, and you will find in it a
saddle and bridle which you must put on me. Then you
will find in the room some beautiful clothes such as princes
wear; these you must put on yourself; and you must take
the sword and gun you will find there too. Then you must
mount on my back.&rdquo; Now Katar was a fairy-horse, and
came from the fairies&rsquo; country, so he could get anything he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
wanted; but neither the King nor any of his people knew this.
When all was ready, Katar burst out of his stable, with the
prince on his back, rushed past the King himself before the
King had time to shoot him, galloped away to the great
jungle-plain, and galloped about all over it. The King saw
his horse had a boy on his back, though he could not see
the boy distinctly. The sepoys tried in vain to shoot the
horse; he galloped much too fast; and at last they were all
scattered over the plain. Then the King had to give it up
and go home; and his sepoys went to their homes. The
King could not shoot any of his sepoys for letting his horse
escape, for he himself had let him do so.</p>

<p>Then Katar galloped away, on, and on, and on; and when
night came they stayed under a tree, he and the King&rsquo;s son.
The horse ate grass, and the boy wild fruits which he found
in the jungle. Next morning they started afresh, and went
far, and far, till they came to a jungle in another country,
which did not belong to the little prince&rsquo;s father, but to another
king. Here Katar said to the boy, &ldquo;Now get off my back.&rdquo;
Off jumped the prince. &ldquo;Unsaddle me and take off my
bridle; take off your beautiful clothes and tie them all up
in a bundle with your sword and gun.&rdquo; This the boy did.
Then the horse gave him some poor, common clothes, which
he told him to put on. As soon as he was dressed in them
the horse said, &ldquo;Hide your bundle in this grass, and I will
take care of it for you. I will always stay in this jungle-plain,
so that when you want me you will always find me. You
must now go away and find service with some one in this
country.&rdquo; This made the boy very sad. &ldquo;I know nothing
about anything,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What shall I do all alone in this
country?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not be afraid,&rdquo; answered Katar. &ldquo;You
will find service, and I will always stay here to help you when
you want me. So go, only before you go, twist my right ear.&rdquo;
The boy did so, and his horse instantly became a donkey.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now twist your right ear,&rdquo; said Katar. And when the boy
had twisted it, he was no longer a handsome prince, but a
poor, common-looking, ugly man; and his moon and star
were hidden.</p>

<p>Then he went away further into the country, until he came
to a grain merchant of the country, who asked him who he was.
&ldquo;I am a poor man,&rdquo; answered the boy, &ldquo;and I want service.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the grain merchant, &ldquo;you shall be my servant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the grain merchant lived near the King&rsquo;s palace, and
one night at twelve o&rsquo;clock the boy was very hot; so he
went out into the King&rsquo;s cool garden, and began to sing a
lovely song. The seventh and youngest daughter of the
King heard him, and she wondered who it was who could
sing so deliciously. Then she put on her clothes, rolled up
her hair, and came down to where the seemingly poor common
man was lying singing. &ldquo;Who are you? where do you
come from?&rdquo; she asked. But he answered nothing. &ldquo;Who
is this man who does not answer when I speak to him?&rdquo;
thought the little princess, and she went away. On the
second night the same thing happened, and on the third
night too. But on the third night, when she found she could
not make him answer her, she said to him, &ldquo;What a strange
man you are not to answer me when I speak to you.&rdquo; But
still he remained silent, so she went away.</p>

<p>The next day when he had finished his work, the young
prince went to the jungle to see his horse, who asked him,
&ldquo;Are you quite well and happy?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; answered
the boy. &ldquo;I am servant to a grain merchant. The last three
nights I have gone into the King&rsquo;s garden and sung a song.
And each night the youngest princess has come to me and
asked me who I am, and whence I came, and I have answered
nothing. What shall I do now?&rdquo; The horse said, &ldquo;Next
time she asks you who you are, tell her you are a very poor
man, and came from your own country to find service here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
The boy then went home to the grain merchant, and at
night, when every one had gone to bed, he went to the King&rsquo;s
garden and sang his sweet song again. The youngest princess
heard him, got up, dressed, and came to him. &ldquo;Who
are you? Whence do you come?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I am a
very poor man,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I came from my own
country to seek service here, and I am now one of the grain
merchant&rsquo;s servants.&rdquo; Then she went away. For three
more nights the boy sang in the King&rsquo;s garden, and each
night the princess came and asked him the same questions
as before, and the boy gave her the same answers.</p>

<p>Then she went to her father, and said to him, &ldquo;Father,
I wish to be married; but I must choose my husband myself.&rdquo;
Her father consented to this, and he wrote and invited
all the Kings and R&aacute;j&aacute;s in the land, saying, &ldquo;My
youngest daughter wishes to be married, but she insists on
choosing her husband herself. As I do not know who it is
she wishes to marry, I beg you will all come on a certain
day, for her to see you and make her choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great many Kings, R&aacute;j&aacute;s, and their sons accepted this
invitation and came. When they had all arrived, the little
princess&rsquo;s father said to them, &ldquo;To-morrow morning you
must all sit together in my garden&rdquo; (the King&rsquo;s garden was
very large), &ldquo;for then my youngest daughter will come and
see you all, and choose her husband. I do not know whom
she will choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youngest princess ordered a grand elephant to be
ready for her the next morning, and when the morning
came, and all was ready, she dressed herself in the most
lovely clothes, and put on her beautiful jewels; then she
mounted her elephant, which was painted blue. In her
hand she took a gold necklace.</p>

<p>Then she went into the garden where the Kings, R&aacute;j&aacute;s,
and their sons were seated. The boy, the grain merchant&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
servant, was also in the garden: not as a suitor, but looking
on with the other servants.</p>

<p>The princess rode all round the garden, and looked at
all the Kings and R&aacute;j&aacute;s and princes, and then she hung
the gold necklace round the neck of the boy, the grain merchant&rsquo;s
servant. At this everybody laughed, and the Kings
were greatly astonished. But then they and the R&aacute;j&aacute;s said,
&ldquo;What fooling is this?&rdquo; and they pushed the pretended
poor man away, and took the necklace off his neck, and said
to him, &ldquo;Get out of the way, you poor, dirty man. Your
clothes are far too dirty for you to come near us!&rdquo; The boy
went far away from them, and stood a long way off to see
what would happen.</p>

<p>Then the King&rsquo;s youngest daughter went all round the garden
again, holding her gold necklace in her hand, and once
more she hung it round the boy&rsquo;s neck. Every one laughed
at her and said, &ldquo;How can the King&rsquo;s daughter think of
marrying this poor, common man!&rdquo; and the Kings and the
R&aacute;j&aacute;s, who had come as suitors, all wanted to turn him out
of the garden. But the princess said, &ldquo;Take care! take
care! You must not turn him out. Leave him alone.&rdquo;
Then she put him on her elephant, and took him to the palace.</p>

<p>The Kings and R&aacute;j&aacute;s and their sons were very much
astonished, and said, &ldquo;What does this mean? The princess
does not care to marry one of us, but chooses that very poor
man!&rdquo; Her father then stood up, and said to them all,
&ldquo;I promised my daughter she should marry any one she
pleased, and as she has twice chosen that poor, common
man, she shall marry him.&rdquo; And so the princess and the
boy were married with great pomp and splendour: her father
and mother were quite content with her choice; and the
Kings, the R&aacute;j&aacute;s and their sons, all returned to their homes.</p>

<p>Now the princess&rsquo;s six sisters had all married rich princes&mdash;and
they laughed at her for choosing such a poor ugly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
husband as hers seemed to be, and said to each other, mockingly,
&ldquo;See! our sister has married this poor, common man!&rdquo;
Their six husbands used to go out hunting every day, and
every evening they brought home quantities of all kinds of
game to their wives, and the game was cooked for their
dinner and for the King&rsquo;s; but the husband of the youngest
princess always stayed at home in the palace, and never
went out hunting at all. This made her very sad, and she
said to herself, &ldquo;My sisters&rsquo; husbands hunt every day, but
my husband never hunts at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last she said to him, &ldquo;Why do you never go out hunting
as my sisters&rsquo; husbands do every day, and every day they
bring home quantities of all kinds of game? Why do you
always stay at home, instead of doing as they do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day he said to her, &ldquo;I am going out to-day to eat
the air.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;go, and take one
of the horses.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the young prince, &ldquo;I will not
ride, I will walk.&rdquo; Then he went to the jungle-plain where
he had left Katar, who all this time had seemed to be a
donkey, and he told Katar everything. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;I have married the youngest princess; and when we were
married everybody laughed at her for choosing me, and said,
&lsquo;What a very poor, common man our princess has chosen
for her husband!&rsquo; Besides, my wife is very sad, for her six
sisters&rsquo; husbands all hunt every day, and bring home quantities
of game, and their wives therefore are very proud of
them. But I stay at home all day, and never hunt. To-day
I should like to hunt very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Katar, &ldquo;then twist my left ear;&rdquo; and as soon
as the boy had twisted it, Katar was a horse again, and
not a donkey any longer. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Katar, &ldquo;twist your
left ear, and you will see what a beautiful young prince
you will become.&rdquo; So the boy twisted his own left ear, and
there he stood no longer a poor, common, ugly man, but a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
grand young prince with a moon on his forehead and a
star on his chin. Then he put on his splendid clothes, saddled
and bridled Katar, got on his back with his sword and
gun, and rode off to hunt.</p>

<p>He rode very far, and shot a great many birds and a
quantity of deer. That day his six brothers-in-law could
find no game, for the beautiful young prince had shot it all.
Nearly all the day long these six princes wandered about
looking in vain for game; till at last they grew hungry and
thirsty, and could find no water, and they had no food with
them. Meanwhile the beautiful young prince had sat down
under a tree, to dine and rest, and there his six brothers-in-law
found him. By his side was some delicious water, and
also some roast meat.</p>

<p>When they saw him the six princes said to each other,
&ldquo;Look at that handsome prince. He has a moon on his
forehead and a star on his chin. We have never seen such
a prince in this jungle before; he must come from another
country.&rdquo; Then they came up to him, and made him
many salaams, and begged him to give them some food and
water. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said the young prince. &ldquo;We
are the husbands of the six elder daughters of the King of
this country,&rdquo; they answered; &ldquo;and we have hunted all day,
and are very hungry and thirsty.&rdquo; They did not recognize
their brother-in-law in the least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the young prince, &ldquo;I will give you something
to eat and drink if you will do as I bid you.&rdquo; &ldquo;We
will do all you tell us to do,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;for if we do
not get water to drink, we shall die.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said
the young prince. &ldquo;Now you must let me put a red-hot
pice on the back of each of you, and then I will give you
food and water. Do you agree to this?&rdquo; The six princes
consented, for they thought, &ldquo;No one will ever see the
mark of the pice, as it will be covered by our clothes; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
we shall die if we have no water to drink.&rdquo; Then the young
prince took six pice, and made them red-hot in the fire; he
laid one on the back of each of the six princes, and gave
them good food and water. They ate and drank; and when
they had finished they made him many salaams and went
home.</p>

<p>The young prince stayed under the tree till it was evening;
then he mounted his horse and rode off to the King&rsquo;s
palace. All the people looked at him as he came riding
along, saying, &ldquo;What a splendid young prince that is! He
has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.&rdquo; But no
one recognized him. When he came near the King&rsquo;s palace,
all the King&rsquo;s servants asked him who he was; and as none
of them knew him, the gate-keepers would not let him pass
in. They all wondered who he could be, and all thought
him the most beautiful prince that had ever been seen.</p>

<p>At last they asked him who he was. &ldquo;I am the husband
of your youngest princess,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;No, no, indeed
you are not,&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;for he is a poor, common-looking,
and ugly man.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I am he,&rdquo; answered the prince;
only no one would believe him. &ldquo;Tell us the truth,&rdquo; said
the servants; &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Perhaps you cannot recognize
me,&rdquo; said the young prince, &ldquo;but call the youngest
princess here. I wish to speak to her.&rdquo; The servants called
her, and she came. &ldquo;That man is not my husband,&rdquo; she
said at once. &ldquo;My husband is not nearly as handsome as
that man. This must be a prince from another country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she said to him, &ldquo;Who are you? Why do you say
you are my husband?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because I am your husband. I
am telling you the truth,&rdquo; answered the young prince. &ldquo;No
you are not, you are not telling me the truth,&rdquo; said the little
princess. &ldquo;My husband is not a handsome man like you.
I married a very poor, common-looking man.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is
true,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but nevertheless I am your husband.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
I was the grain merchant&rsquo;s servant; and one hot night I
went into your father&rsquo;s garden and sang, and you heard me,
and came and asked me who I was and where I came from,
and I would not answer you. And the same thing happened
the next night, and the next, and on the fourth I told you
I was a very poor man, and had come from my country to
seek service in yours, and that I was the grain merchant&rsquo;s
servant. Then you told your father you wished to marry,
but must choose your own husband; and when all the Kings
and R&aacute;j&aacute;s were seated in your father&rsquo;s garden, you sat on
an elephant and went round and looked at them all; and
then twice hung your gold necklace round my neck, and
chose me. See, here is your necklace, and here are the ring
and the handkerchief you gave me on our wedding day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she believed him, and was very glad that her husband
was such a beautiful young prince. &ldquo;What a strange
man you are!&rdquo; she said to him. &ldquo;Till now you have been
poor, and ugly, and common-looking. Now you are beautiful
and look like a prince; I never saw such a handsome
man as you are before; and yet I know you must be my husband.&rdquo;
Then she worshipped God and thanked him for
letting her have such a husband. &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a
beautiful husband. There is no one like him in this country.
He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.&rdquo;
Then she took him into the palace, and showed him to her
father and mother and to every one. They all said they had
never seen any one like him, and were all very happy. And
the young prince lived as before in the King&rsquo;s palace with his
wife, and Katar lived in the King&rsquo;s stables.</p>

<p>One day, when the King and his seven sons-in-law were
in his court-house, and it was full of people, the young prince
said to him, &ldquo;There are six thieves here in your court-house.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Six thieves!&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;Where are they? Show
them to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;There they are,&rdquo; said the young prince,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
pointing to his six brothers-in-law. The King and every
one else in the court-house were very much astonished, and
would not believe the young prince. &ldquo;Take off their coats,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and then you will see for yourselves that each of
them has the mark of a thief on his back.&rdquo; So their coats
were taken off the six princes, and the King and everybody
in the court-house saw the marks of the red-hot pice. The
six princes were very much ashamed, but the young prince
was very glad. He had not forgotten how his brothers-in-law
had laughed at him and mocked him when he seemed
a poor, common man.</p>

<p>Now when Katar was still in the jungle, before the prince
was married, he had told the boy the whole story of his
birth, and all that had happened to him and his mother.
&ldquo;When you are married,&rdquo; he said to him, &ldquo;I will take you
back to your father&rsquo;s country.&rdquo; So two months after the
young prince had revenged himself on his brothers-in-law,
Katar said to him, &ldquo;It is time for you to return to your father.
Get the King to let you go to your own country, and I will
tell you what to do when we get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince always did what his horse told him to do; so
he went to his wife and said to her, &ldquo;I wish very much to
go to my own country to see my father and mother.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very
well,&rdquo; said his wife; &ldquo;I will tell my father and mother, and
ask them to let us go.&rdquo; Then she went to them, and told
them, and they consented to let her and her husband leave
them. The King gave his daughter and the young prince
a great many horses, and elephants, and all sorts of presents,
and also a great many sepoys to guard them. In this grand
state they travelled to the prince&rsquo;s country, which was not a
great many miles off. When they reached it they pitched
their tents on the same plain in which the prince had been
left in his box by the nurse, where Shankar and Sur&iacute; had
swallowed him so often.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
When the King, his father, the gardener&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s husband,
saw the prince&rsquo;s camp, he was very much alarmed,
and thought a great King had come to make war on him.
He sent one of his servants, therefore, to ask whose camp
it was. The young prince then wrote him a letter, in which
he said, &ldquo;You are a great King. Do not fear me. I am
not come to make war on you. I am as if I were your son.
I am a prince who has come to see your country and to
speak with you. I wish to give you a grand feast, to which
everyone in your country must come&mdash;men and women, old
and young, rich and poor, of all castes; all the children,
fak&iacute;rs, and sepoys. You must bring them all here to me
for a week, and I will feast them all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The King was delighted with this letter, and ordered all
the men, women, and children of all castes, fak&iacute;rs and sepoys,
in his country to go to the prince&rsquo;s camp to a grand feast the
prince would give them. So they all came, and the King
brought his four wives too. All came, at least all but the
gardener&rsquo;s daughter. No one had told her to go to the
feast, for no one had thought of her.</p>

<p>When all the people were assembled, the prince saw his
mother was not there, and he asked the King, &ldquo;Has every
one in your country come to my feast?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, everyone,&rdquo;
said the King. &ldquo;Are you sure of that?&rdquo; asked the prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; answered the King. &ldquo;I am sure one woman
has not come,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;She is your gardener&rsquo;s
daughter, who was once your wife and is now a servant in
your palace.&rdquo; &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;I had forgotten
her.&rdquo; Then the prince told his servants to take his finest
palanquin and to fetch the gardener&rsquo;s daughter. They were
to bathe her, dress her in beautiful clothes and handsome
jewels, and then bring her to him in the palanquin.</p>

<p>While the servants were bringing the gardener&rsquo;s daughter,
the King thought how handsome the young prince was; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
he noticed particularly the moon on his forehead and the
star on his chin, and he wondered in what country the young
prince was born.</p>

<p>And now the palanquin arrived bringing the gardener&rsquo;s
daughter, and the young prince went himself and took her
out of it, and brought her into the tent. He made her a
great many salaams. The four wicked wives looked on and
were very much surprised and very angry. They remembered
that, when they arrived, the prince had made them
no salaams, and since then had not taken the least notice of
them; whereas he could not do enough for the gardener&rsquo;s
daughter, and seemed very glad to see her.</p>

<p>When they were all at dinner, the prince again made the
gardener&rsquo;s daughter a great many salaams, and gave her
food from all the nicest dishes. She wondered at his kindness
to her, and thought, &ldquo;Who is this handsome prince,
with a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin? I
never saw any one so beautiful. What country does he come
from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two or three days were thus passed in feasting, and all
that time the King and his people were talking about the
prince&rsquo;s beauty, and wondering who he was.</p>

<p>One day the prince asked the King if he had any children.
&ldquo;None,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Do you know who I am?&rdquo;
asked the prince. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;Tell me who you
are.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am your son,&rdquo; answered the prince, &ldquo;and the gardener&rsquo;s
daughter is my mother.&rdquo; The King shook his head
sadly. &ldquo;How can you be my son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I have
never had any children?&rdquo; &ldquo;But I am your son,&rdquo; answered the
prince. &ldquo;Your four wicked wives told you the gardener&rsquo;s
daughter had given you a stone and not a son; but it was they
who put the stone in my little bed, and then they tried to kill
me.&rdquo; The King did not believe him. &ldquo;I wish you were my
son,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but as I never had a child, you cannot be my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
son.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you remember your dog Shankar, and how you
had him killed? And do you remember your cow Sur&iacute;, and
how you had her killed too? Your wives made you kill
them because of me. And,&rdquo; he said, taking the King to
Katar, &ldquo;do you know whose horse that is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The King looked at Katar, and then said, &ldquo;That is my
horse Katar.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Prince. &ldquo;Do you not
remember how he rushed past you out of his stable with me
on his back?&rdquo; Then Katar told the King the prince was
really his son, and told him all the story of his birth, and of
his life up to that moment; and when the King found the
beautiful prince was indeed his son, he was so glad, so glad.
He put his arms round him and kissed him and cried for joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;you must come with me to my
palace, and live with me always.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the prince,
&ldquo;that I cannot do. I cannot go to your palace. I only came
here to fetch my mother; and now that I have found her, I
will take her with me to my father-in-law&rsquo;s palace. I have
married a King&rsquo;s daughter, and we live with her father.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But now that I have found you, I cannot let you go,&rdquo; said
his father. &ldquo;You and your wife must come and live with
your mother and me in my palace.&rdquo; &ldquo;That we will never
do,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;unless you will kill your four wicked
wives with your own hand. If you will do that, we will
come and live with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the King killed his wives, and then he and his wife,
the gardener&rsquo;s daughter, and the prince and his wife, all
went to live in the King&rsquo;s palace, and lived there happily
together for ever after; and the King thanked God for giving
him such a beautiful son, and for ridding him of his four
wicked wives.</p>

<p>Katar did not return to the fairies&rsquo; country, but stayed
always with the young prince, and never left him.</p>

THE B&Eacute;L-PRINCESS.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxxi">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapi"><span class="dcap">I</span></span>N a country lived a King who had seven sons. Six
of these sons married, but the seventh and youngest
son would not marry; and, moreover, he disliked
his six sisters-in-law, and could not bear to take food from
their hands. One day, they got very angry with him for
disliking them, and they said to him, taunting him, &ldquo;We
think that you will marry a B&eacute;l-Princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A B&eacute;l-Princess,&rdquo; said the young prince to himself.
&ldquo;What is a B&eacute;l-Princess? and where is one to be found?
I will go and look for one.&rdquo; But the next day he thought,
&ldquo;How can I find a B&eacute;l-Princess? I don&rsquo;t know where to
seek for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last one day he saddled and bridled one of his father&rsquo;s
beautiful horses. Then he put on his grand clothes, took
his sword and gun, and said good-bye to his father and
mother, and set out on his search. They cried very much
at parting with him.</p>

<p>He rode from his father&rsquo;s country for a long, long way.
At length, when he had journeyed for six months, he found
himself in a great jungle, through which he went for many
nights and days, until he at last came to where a fak&iacute;r lay
sleeping. The young prince thought, &ldquo;I will watch by this
fak&iacute;r till he wakes. Perhaps he can help me.&rdquo; So he stayed
with the fak&iacute;r for one whole month; and all that time he took
care of him and watched by him, and kept his hut clean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
This fak&iacute;r used to sleep for six whole months at a time, and
then he would remain awake for six months.</p>

<p>When the prince had watched over him for one month
the fak&iacute;r woke, for his six months&rsquo; sleep had come to an end;
and when he saw what care the young prince had taken of
him, and how clean his hut was, he was very much pleased
with the King&rsquo;s son, and said to him, &ldquo;How have you
been able to reach this jungle, to which no man can come?
and who are you? and whence do you come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a King&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; answered the prince. &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s
country is a six months&rsquo; journey away from this; and I am
come to look for a B&eacute;l-Princess. I hear there is a B&eacute;l-Princess,
and I want to find her. Can you tell me where
she is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true that there is one,&rdquo; answered the fak&iacute;r, &ldquo;and I
know where she is. She is in the fairies&rsquo; country, whither
no man can go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This made the young prince very sad. &ldquo;What shall I
do?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have left my father and mother, and
have travelled a long, long way to find the B&eacute;l-Princess.
And now you tell me I cannot go where she lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will help you,&rdquo; said the fak&iacute;r, &ldquo;and if you do exactly
what I tell you, you will find her. But, first, stay here with
me for a little while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the King&rsquo;s son stayed for another month with the fak&iacute;r,
and took care of him, and did everything for him, as he did
for his own father.</p>

<p>At the end of the month, the fak&iacute;r gave him his stick, and
said to him, &ldquo;Now you must go to the fairies&rsquo; country. It
is one week&rsquo;s journey distant from this jungle. When you
get there, you will see a number of demons and fairies who
live in it.&rdquo; Then the fak&iacute;r took a little earth from the
ground, and put it in the prince&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;When you have
come to the fairies&rsquo; country, in order that they and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
demons may not see you, you must blow all this earth away
from the palm of your hand, and then you will be invisible.
You must ride on till you come to a great plain in the
middle of their garden, and on this plain you will see a
large b&eacute;l-tree and on it one big b&eacute;l-fruit. In this fruit is the
B&eacute;l-Princess. You must throw my stick at it, and it will
fall; but you must take care to catch the fruit in your
shawl, and not let it fall to the ground. Then ride quickly
back to me, for as soon as the fruit falls you will cease to
be invisible, and the fairies and demons who guard the fruit
will all come running after you, and they will all call to you.
But take care, take care not to look behind you when they
call you. Ride straight on to me with the fruit, and do
not look behind you. If you do, you will become stone, and
your horse too, and they will take the b&eacute;l-fruit back to its
tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince promised to do all the fak&iacute;r bade him. He
rode for a week, and then he came to the fairies&rsquo; country.
He blew the earth the fak&iacute;r had given him away from
his palm all along his fingers, just as he had been told,
and then he became invisible. He rode through the great
garden to the plain. There he saw the b&eacute;l-tree, and the
one fruit hanging all alone. He threw the fak&iacute;r&rsquo;s stick at
it, and caught it in a corner of his shawl as it fell, but
then he was no longer invisible. All the fairies and demons
could see him, and they came running after him as
he rode quickly away, and called to him. He looked
behind at them, and instantly he and his horse became
stone; and the b&eacute;l-fruit went back to its tree and hung itself
up.</p>

<p>For one week the fak&iacute;r sat in his jungle, waiting for the
King&rsquo;s son. But the moment he was turned into stone, the
fak&iacute;r knew of it, and he set off at once for the fairies&rsquo; country.
He walked all through it, but neither the fairies nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
demons could touch him. He went straight to the great
plain, and there he saw the King&rsquo;s son sitting on his horse,
and both he and the horse were stone.</p>

<p>This made the fak&iacute;r very sad; and he said to God,
&ldquo;What will the father and mother do, now that their son is
changed into a stone?&rdquo; And he prayed to God and said,
&ldquo;If it be God&rsquo;s pleasure, may this King&rsquo;s son be alive once
more.&rdquo; Then he cut his little finger on the inside from the tip
to the palm, and smeared the prince&rsquo;s forehead with the blood
that came from it. He rubbed some blood on the horse too,
all the time praying to God to give the prince his life again.
The King&rsquo;s son and his horse were alive once more. The
fak&iacute;r took the prince back to his jungle, and said to him,
&ldquo;Listen. I told you not to look behind you, and you disobeyed
me and so were turned to stone. Had I not come
to save you, you would always have remained stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fak&iacute;r kept the prince with him in the jungle for one
whole week. Then he gave him his stick and some earth
he picked up from the ground on which they were standing,
and said, &ldquo;Now you must go to the fairies&rsquo; country again,
and throw my stick at the b&eacute;l-fruit, and catch it in a corner
of your shawl as you did before. But mind, mind you do
not look behind you this time. If you do you will be
turned to stone, and you will for ever remain stone. Ride
straight back to me with the fruit, and take care never to
look behind you once till you get to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the King&rsquo;s son went again to the fairies&rsquo; country, and
all happened as before, till he had caught the fruit in his
shawl. But then he rode straight back to the fak&iacute;r without
looking behind him, although the fairies and demons ran
after him and called to him the whole way.</p>

<p>He rode so fast they could not catch him, and when he
came to the fak&iacute;r, the fak&iacute;r turned him into a fly and thus
hid him. Up came all the fairies and demons and said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
the fak&iacute;r, &ldquo;There is a thief in your hut.&rdquo; &ldquo;A thief! Where
is the thief?&rdquo; said the fak&iacute;r. &ldquo;Look everywhere for him, and
take him away if you can find him.&rdquo; Then they searched
and searched everywhere, but could not find the prince; so
at last they went away.</p>

<p>When they had all gone, the fak&iacute;r took the little fly and
turned it back into a King&rsquo;s son. A few days afterwards
he said to the prince, &ldquo;Now you have found what you
wanted; you have the B&eacute;l-Princess you came to seek. So
go back to your father and mother.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the
prince. Then he got his horse all ready for the journey,
took the b&eacute;l-fruit, and made many salaams to the fak&iacute;r, who
said to him, &ldquo;Now, listen. Take care not to open the fruit
on the road. Wait till you are in your father&rsquo;s house with
your father and mother, and then open it. If you do not do
exactly as I tell you, evil will happen to you; so mind you
only open the fruit in your father&rsquo;s house. Out of it will
come the B&eacute;l-Princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince set out on his journey, and rode on and on
for six months till he came to his father&rsquo;s country, and then
to his father&rsquo;s garden. There he sat down to rest by a well
under a clump of great trees. He said to himself, &ldquo;Now
that I am in my father&rsquo;s country, and in my father&rsquo;s garden,
I will sit and rest in this cool shade; and when I am rested
I will go up to the palace.&rdquo; He bathed his face and his
hands in the well, and drank some of its water. Then he
thought, &ldquo;Surely, now that I am in my father&rsquo;s country and
in his garden, I need not wait till I get to his palace to open
my b&eacute;l-fruit. What harm can happen if I do open it
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he broke it open, in spite of all the fak&iacute;r had told him,
and out of it came such a beautiful girl. She was more
beautiful than any princess that ever was seen&mdash;so beautiful
that the King&rsquo;s son fainted when he saw her. The princess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
fanned him, and poured water on his face, and presently
he recovered, and said to her, &ldquo;Princess, I should like to
sleep for a little while, for I have travelled for six months,
and am very tired. After I have slept we will go together to
my father&rsquo;s palace.&rdquo; So he went to sleep, and the princess
sat by him.</p>

<p>Presently a woman came to the well for water, and she
said to herself, &ldquo;See, here is the King&rsquo;s youngest son. What
a lovely princess that is sitting by him! What fine clothes
and jewels she has on!&rdquo; And the wicked woman determined
to kill the princess and to take her place. Then she
came up to the beautiful girl, and sat down beside her, and
talked to her. &ldquo;Listen to me, princess,&rdquo; she said at last.
&ldquo;Let us change clothes with each other. Give me yours,
and I will give you mine.&rdquo; The princess, thinking no harm,
did as the woman suggested. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the woman,
&ldquo;let me put on your beautiful jewels.&rdquo; The princess gave
them to her, and then the wicked, wicked woman, said to
her, &ldquo;Let us walk about this pretty garden, and look at the
flowers, and amuse ourselves.&rdquo; By and by she said, &ldquo;Princess,
let us go and look at ourselves in the well, and see what
we look like, you in my clothes, and I in yours.&rdquo; The young
girl consented, and they went to the well. As they bent over
the side to look in, the wicked woman gave the princess a
push, and pushed her straight over the edge into the water.</p>

<p>Then she went and sat down by the sleeping prince, just
as the princess had done. When he awoke and saw this
ugly, wicked woman, instead of his B&eacute;l-Princess, he was
very much surprised, and said to himself, &ldquo;A little while ago
I had a beautiful girl by me, and now there is such an ugly
woman. It is true she has on the clothes and jewels my
B&eacute;l-Princess wore; but she is so ugly, and there is something
wrong with one of her eyes. What has happened to
her?&rdquo; Then he said to this wicked woman, whom he took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
for his B&eacute;l-Princess, &ldquo;What is the matter with you? Has
anything happened to you? Why have you become so
ugly?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;Till now I have always lived in a
b&eacute;l-fruit. It is the bad air of your country that has made
me ugly, and hurt one of my eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince was ashamed of her, and very, very sorry.
&ldquo;How shall I take her to my father&rsquo;s palace now?&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;My mother and all my brothers&rsquo; wives will see
her, and what will they say? However, never mind; I
must take her to my house, and marry her. I cannot think
what can have happened to her.&rdquo; Then he got a palanquin,
and took her up to the palace.</p>

<p>His father and mother were very glad that their youngest
son had come back to them; but when they saw the wicked
woman, and heard she was his B&eacute;l-Princess, they, and every
one else in the palace, said, &ldquo;Can she be a B&eacute;l-Princess?
She is not at all pretty, and she is not at all pleasant.&rdquo; &ldquo;She
was lovely when she came out of the fruit,&rdquo; said the prince.
&ldquo;No one ever saw such a beautiful girl before. I cannot
think what has happened to her. It must be the bad air
of this country that has made her so ugly.&rdquo; Then he told
them all about his journey to the jungle where he had met
the fak&iacute;r, and how, with the fak&iacute;r&rsquo;s help, he had found his
B&eacute;l-Princess, and how he had opened the fruit in his father&rsquo;s
garden, and then fallen asleep.</p>

<p>The King made a great wedding-feast for his son, and
he and the wicked woman were married, and all the time
the King&rsquo;s youngest son thought he was marrying the B&eacute;l-Princess.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the beautiful girl had not been drowned in the
well, but had changed into a most lovely pink lotus-flower.
This flower was first seen by a man from the village who
came to the well for water. &ldquo;What a lovely lotus-flower!&rdquo;
said the man; &ldquo;I must gather it.&rdquo; But when he tried to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
reach it the flower floated away from him. Then he went
and told all the people in the village of the beautiful flower,
and then the palace servants heard of it. They all tried to
gather it, but could not, for the flower always went just out
of their reach. Then the King and his six elder sons heard
of it, and they came to the well; but the King tried in vain
to gather it, and his six sons too. The lotus-flower always
floated away from them.</p>

<p>Last of all, the youngest prince heard of the lotus, and he
grew very curious to see it, and said, &ldquo;I will try if I cannot
gather this wonderful flower that no one can touch.&rdquo; So he,
too, came to the well, and stooped, and stretched out his
hand, and the minute he did so the flower floated of itself
into his hand.</p>

<p>Then he was very happy and proud, and he took the
flower up to his wife and showed it to her. &ldquo;Just see,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;every one in the village and the palace were talking
of this lotus-flower; and every one tried to gather it; and no
one could, for the flower would not let any one touch it.
My father tried, and my brothers all tried, and they, too, could
not gather it; but as soon as I stretched out my hand the
flower floated into it of itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When his wicked wife saw the flower, she said nothing;
but her heart told her it was the beautiful girl she had pushed
into the well. The prince laid the flower on his pillow, and
was very glad and happy. As soon as he had gone out, his
wife seized the lotus-flower, tore it to bits, and threw them
far away into the garden.</p>

<p>In a few days a b&eacute;l-tree was growing on the spot where
she had thrown the pieces of the lotus-flower. On it grew
one big b&eacute;l-fruit, and it was so fine and large that every
one in the village and the palace tried to gather it; but no
one could touch it, for the fruit always went just out of
reach. The King and his six elder sons also tried, but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
could not touch it. The youngest prince heard of this fruit,
so he said to his wife, &ldquo;I will go and see if I can gather
this b&eacute;l-fruit that no one can even touch.&rdquo; The wicked
woman&rsquo;s heart said to her, &ldquo;In the b&eacute;l-fruit is the B&eacute;l-Princess;&rdquo;
but she said nothing.</p>

<p>The prince went to the b&eacute;l-tree; the b&eacute;l-fruit came into
his hand, and he broke it off the tree, and brought it home
to his wife. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here is the b&eacute;l-fruit; it let
me gather it at once.&rdquo; And he was very proud and happy.
Then he laid the fruit on a table in his room.</p>

<p>When he had gone out the wicked wife came, and took
the fruit, and flung it away in the garden. In the night the
fruit burst in two, and in it lay a lovely, tiny girl baby. The
gardener, as he went round the garden early in the morning,
found the little baby; and he wondered who had thrown
away the beautiful fruit, and who the lovely baby girl could
be. She was so tiny and so pretty, and the gardener was
delighted when he saw her, for he had no children, and
thought God had sent him a little child at last.</p>

<p>He took her in his arms and carried her to his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have never had any children, and
now God has sent us this beautiful little girl.&rdquo; His wife
looked at the child, and she was as delighted with her as her
husband was. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;God has sent us this child,
and she is certainly most beautiful. I am very happy. But I
have no milk for her; if only I had milk for her, I could nurse
her and she would live.&rdquo; And the gardener&rsquo;s wife was very sad
to think she had no milk in her breasts for the little child.</p>

<p>Then her husband said, &ldquo;Let us ask God to send you milk
for her.&rdquo; So they prayed to God and worshipped him. And
God was pleased with them both, and sent the gardener&rsquo;s
wife a great deal of milk.</p>

<p>The little girl now lived in the gardener&rsquo;s house, and he
and his wife took the greatest care of her, and were very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
happy to think they had now a child. She grew very fast,
and became lovelier every day. She was more beautiful
than any girl that had ever been seen, and all the people in
the King&rsquo;s country used to say, &ldquo;How lovely the gardener&rsquo;s
daughter is! She is more beautiful than any princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The King&rsquo;s youngest son&rsquo;s wicked wife heard of the child,
and her heart told her, &ldquo;She is the B&eacute;l-Princess.&rdquo; She said
nothing, but she often thought of how she could contrive to
have her killed.</p>

<p>One day, when the gardener&rsquo;s daughter was seven years
old, she was out in her father&rsquo;s garden, making a little garden
of her own near the house-door. While she was busy over
her flowers, the wicked woman&rsquo;s cow strayed into the garden
and began eating the plants in it. The little girl would not
let it make its dinner off her father&rsquo;s flowers and grass, but
pushed it out of the garden.</p>

<p>The wicked woman was told how the gardener&rsquo;s daughter
had treated her cow; so she cried all day long, and pretended
to be ill. When her husband asked her what was the
matter, she answered, &ldquo;I am sick because the gardener&rsquo;s
daughter has ill-treated my cow. She beat it, and turned it
out of her father&rsquo;s garden, and said many wicked things.
If you will have the girl killed, I shall live; but if you do
not kill her, I shall die.&rdquo; The prince at once ordered his
servants to take the gardener&rsquo;s daughter the next morning to
the jungle, and there kill her.</p>

<p>So the next morning early the servants went to the
gardener&rsquo;s house to take away his daughter. He and his wife
cried bitterly, and begged the servants to leave the girl with
them. They offered them a great many rupees, saying,
&ldquo;Take these rupees, and leave us our daughter.&rdquo; &ldquo;How
can we leave you your daughter,&rdquo; said the servants, &ldquo;when
the King&rsquo;s youngest son has ordered us to take her to the
jungle and kill her, that his wife may get well?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
So they led the girl away; and as they went to the jungle,
they said to each other, &ldquo;How beautiful this girl is!&rdquo; They
found her so beautiful that they grew very sorrowful at the
thought of killing her.</p>

<p>They took the girl to a great plain, which was about ten
miles distant from the King&rsquo;s country; but when they got
there they said they could not kill her. She was so beautiful
that they really could not kill her. She said to them,
&ldquo;You were ordered to kill me, so kill me.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; they
answered, &ldquo;we cannot kill you, we cannot kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the girl took the knife in her own hand and cut out
her two eyes; and one eye became a parrot, and the other
a <i>main&aacute;</i>. Then she cut out her heart and it became a great
tank. Her body became a splendid palace and garden&mdash;a
far grander palace than was the King&rsquo;s palace; her arms and
legs became the pillars that supported the verandah roof;
and her head the dome on the top of the palace.</p>

<p>The prince&rsquo;s servants looked on all the time these changes
were taking place, and they were so frightened by them, that
when they got home they would not tell the prince or any
one else what they had seen. No one lived in this wonderful
house. It stood empty in its garden by its tank, and
the parrot and <i>main&aacute;</i> lived in the garden trees.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards the youngest prince went out hunting,
and towards evening he found himself on the great plain
where stood the wonderful palace. He rode up to it and
said to himself, &ldquo;I never saw any house here before. I wonder
who lives here?&rdquo; He went through the great gate into the
garden, and then he saw the large tank, and how beautiful
the garden was. He went all through the garden and was
delighted with it, and he saw that it was beautifully kept, and
was in perfect order. Then he went into the palace, and went
through all the rooms, and wondered more and more to
whom this beautiful house could belong. He was very much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
surprised, too, at finding no one in the palace, though the
rooms were all splendidly furnished, and very clean and neat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father is a great king,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;and yet
he has not got a palace like this.&rdquo; It was now deep night,
so the prince knew he could not go home till the next day.
&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will sleep in the verandah. I
am not afraid, though I shall be quite alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he lay down to sleep in the verandah, and while he
lay there, the parrot and <i>main&aacute;</i> flew in, and they perched
near him, for they knew he was there, and they wanted him
to hear what they said to each other. Then they began
chattering together; and the parrot told the <i>main&aacute;</i> how the
prince&rsquo;s father was king of the neighbouring country, and
how he had seven sons, and how six of the sons had married
six princesses, &ldquo;but this prince, who was the youngest son,
would not marry; and what is more, he did not like his
brother&rsquo;s wives at all.&rdquo; Then the birds stopped talking and
did not chatter any more that night. The prince was very
much surprised at the birds knowing who he was, and all
about his dislike to his brothers&rsquo; wives.</p>

<p>The next morning he rode home; and there he stayed all
day, and would not talk. His wife asked him, &ldquo;What is the
matter with you? Why are you so silent?&rdquo; &ldquo;My head aches,&rdquo;
he answered: &ldquo;I am ill.&rdquo; But towards evening he felt he
must go back to the empty palace on the great plain, so he
said to his wife, &ldquo;I am going out to eat the air for a little
while.&rdquo; Then he got on his horse and rode off to the palace.</p>

<p>As soon as he had laid himself down in the verandah, the
parrot and the <i>main&aacute;</i> perched near him; and the parrot
told the <i>main&aacute;</i> how the prince had heard of the B&eacute;l-Princess;
and all about his long journey in search of her, and
how he found the b&eacute;l-fruit, and how he was turned to stone.
Then he stopped chattering, and the birds said nothing
more to each other that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
In the morning the King&rsquo;s son rode home, and was as
silent and grave as he had been before. He told his wife
his head ached when she asked him whether he was ill.</p>

<p>That night he again slept in the verandah of the strange
palace, and heard a little more of his story from the birds.</p>

<p>The next day he was still silent and grave, and his wife
was very uneasy. &ldquo;I am sure the B&eacute;l-Princess is alive,&rdquo; she
said to herself, &ldquo;and that he goes every night to see her.&rdquo;
Then she asked him, &ldquo;Why do you go out every evening?
Why do you not stay at home?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am not well,&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;so I go to my mother&rsquo;s house&rdquo; (the prince had
a little house of his own in his father&rsquo;s compound). &ldquo;I will
not sleep at home again till I am well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night he lay down to sleep again in the verandah of
the great empty palace, and heard the parrot tell the <i>main&aacute;</i>
all that happened to the prince up to the time that he fell
asleep in his father&rsquo;s garden with the beautiful B&eacute;l-Princess
sitting beside him.</p>

<p>On the fifth night the prince lay down to sleep again in the
verandah of the palace on the great plain, and watched eagerly
for the little birds to begin their talk. This night the parrot
told how the wicked woman had come and taken the B&eacute;l-Princess&rsquo;s
clothes, and thrown her down the well; how the
princess became a lotus-flower which the wicked wife broke
to bits; how the bits of the lotus-flower turned into a b&eacute;l-fruit
which she threw away; how out of the fruit came a tiny
girl-baby that the gardener adopted; how the wicked woman
persuaded the prince to have this girl killed when she was
seven years old; how he and the <i>main&aacute;</i> had once been this
girl&rsquo;s eyes; how the tank was once her heart, and how her
body had changed into this palace and garden, while her
head became the dome on the top of the palace.</p>

<p>Then the <i>main&aacute;</i> asked the parrot where the B&eacute;l-Princess
was. &ldquo;Cannot she be found?&rdquo; said the <i>main&aacute;</i>. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
the parrot, &ldquo;she can be found; but the King&rsquo;s youngest son
alone can find her, and he is so foolish! He believes that
his ugly, wicked wife is the beautiful B&eacute;l-Princess!&rdquo; &ldquo;And
where is the princess?&rdquo; asked the <i>main&aacute;</i>. &ldquo;She is here,&rdquo;
said the parrot. &ldquo;If the prince would come one day and go
through all the rooms of this palace till he came to the centre
room, he would see a trap-door in the middle of that room.
If he lifted the trap-door he would see a staircase which
leads to an underground palace, and in this palace is the
B&eacute;l-princess.&rdquo; &ldquo;And can no one but the prince lift the
trap-door?&rdquo; asked the <i>main&aacute;</i>. &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; answered the
parrot. &ldquo;It is God&rsquo;s order that only the King&rsquo;s youngest son
can lift the trap-door and find the B&eacute;l-Princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day the young prince went through all the rooms
of the palace, instead of going home. When he came to
the centre room, he looked for the trap-door, and when he
had lifted it he saw the staircase. He went down it, and
found himself in the under-ground palace, which was far
more beautiful than the one above-ground. It was full of
servants; and in one room a grand dinner was standing
ready. In another room he saw a gold bed, all covered
with pearls and diamonds, and on the bed lay the B&eacute;l-Princess.</p>

<p>Day and night she prayed to God and read a holy book.
She did nothing else.</p>

<p>When the prince went into her room and she saw him,
she was very sad, not happy, for she thought, &ldquo;He is so
foolish; he knows nothing of what has happened to me.&rdquo;
Then she said to him, &ldquo;Why did you come here? Go home
again to your father&rsquo;s palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince burst out crying. &ldquo;See, princess,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I knew nothing of your palace. I only found it by chance
five nights ago. I have slept here in the verandah for the
last five nights, and only last night did I learn what had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
happened to you, and how to find you.&rdquo; &ldquo;I know it is true,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;that you knew nothing of what happened to me.
But now that you have found me, what will you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go home to my father&rsquo;s palace,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;and make everything ready for you, and then I will come
and marry you and take you home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it was all settled, and he ate some food, and returned
to his father. He told his father and mother all that had
happened to the B&eacute;l-Princess, and how her body had turned
into the beautiful garden and palace that stood on the big
plain; and of the little birds; and of the underground
palace in which she now lived. So his father said that he
and the prince&rsquo;s mother, and his six brothers and their wives,
would all take him in great state to the palace and marry
him to the beautiful B&eacute;l-Princess; and that then they would
all return to their own palace, and all live together. &ldquo;But
first the wicked woman must be killed,&rdquo; said the King.</p>

<p>So he ordered his servants to take her to the jungle and
kill her, and throw her body away. So they took her away
at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon and killed her.</p>

<p>One morning two or three days later, the prince and his
father and mother, and brothers and sisters-in-law, went
to the great palace on the wide plain; and there, in the
evening, the king&rsquo;s youngest son was married to the B&eacute;l-Princess.
And when his father and mother and brothers,
and his brothers&rsquo; wives, saw her, they all said, &ldquo;It is quite
true. She is indeed a B&eacute;l-Princess!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the wedding they all returned to the King&rsquo;s palace,
and there they lived together. But the King and his sons
used often to go to the palace on the great plain to eat the
air; and they used to lend it sometimes to other r&aacute;j&aacute;s and
kings.</p>

<br />
HOW THE R&Aacute;J&Aacute;&rsquo;S SON WON THE PRINCESS
LAB&Aacute;M.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxxii">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapi"><span class="dcap">I</span></span>N a country there was a R&aacute;j&aacute; who had an only son
who every day went out to hunt. One day the
R&aacute;n&iacute;, his mother, said to him, &ldquo;You can hunt
wherever you like on these three sides; but you must never
go to the fourth side.&rdquo; This she said because she knew if
he went on the fourth side he would hear of the beautiful
Princess Lab&aacute;m, and that then he would leave his father and
mother and seek for the princess.</p>

<p>The young prince listened to his mother, and obeyed her
for some time; but one day, when he was hunting on the
three sides where he was allowed to go, he remembered what
she had said to him about the fourth side, and he determined
to go and see why she had forbidden him to hunt on that
side. When he got there, he found himself in a jungle, and
nothing in the jungle but a quantity of parrots, who lived in
it. The young R&aacute;j&aacute; shot at some of them, and at once they
all flew away up to the sky. All, that is, but one, and this
was their R&aacute;j&aacute;, who was called H&iacute;r&aacute;man parrot.</p>

<p>When H&iacute;r&aacute;man parrot found himself left alone, he called
out to the other parrots, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fly away and leave me alone
when the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son shoots. If you desert me like this, I will
tell the Princess Lab&aacute;m.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the parrots all flew back to their R&aacute;j&aacute;, chattering.
The prince was greatly surprised, and said, &ldquo;Why, these birds
can talk!&rdquo; Then he said to the parrots, &ldquo;Who is the
Princess Lab&aacute;m? Where does she live?&rdquo; But the parrots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
would not tell him where she lived. &ldquo;You can never get to
the Princess Lab&aacute;m&rsquo;s country.&rdquo; That is all they would say.</p>

<p>The prince grew very sad when they would not tell him
anything more; and he threw his gun away, and went home.
When he got home, he would not speak or eat, but lay on
his bed for four or five days, and seemed very ill.</p>

<p>At last he told his father and mother that he wanted to go
and see the Princess Lab&aacute;m. &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I
must see what she is like. Tell me where her country is.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We do not know where it is,&rdquo; answered his father and
mother. &ldquo;Then I must go and look for it,&rdquo; said the prince.
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;you must not leave us. You are our
only son. Stay with us. You will never find the Princess
Lab&aacute;m.&rdquo; &ldquo;I must try and find her,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;Perhaps
God will show me the way. If I live and I find her,
I will come back to you; but perhaps I shall die, and then
I shall never see you again. Still I must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they had to let him go, though they cried very much
at parting with him. His father gave him fine clothes to
wear, and a fine horse. And he took his gun, and his
bow and arrows, and a great many other weapons, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I may want them.&rdquo; His father, too, gave him plenty
of rupees.</p>

<p>Then he himself got his horse all ready for the journey,
and he said good-bye to his father and mother; and his
mother took her handkerchief and wrapped some sweetmeats
in it, and gave it to her son. &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; she said to him,
&ldquo;when you are hungry eat some of these sweetmeats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then set out on his journey, and rode on and on till he
came to a jungle in which were a tank and shady trees. He
bathed himself and his horse in the tank, and then sat down
under a tree. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I will eat some
of the sweetmeats my mother gave me, and I will drink
some water, and then I will continue my journey.&rdquo; He opened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
his handkerchief, and took out a sweetmeat. He found an
ant in it. He took out another. There was an ant in that
one too. So he laid the two sweetmeats on the ground, and
he took out another, and another, and another, until he had
taken them all out; but in each he found an ant. &ldquo;Never
mind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t eat the sweetmeats; the ants shall
eat them.&rdquo; Then the Ant-R&aacute;j&aacute; came and stood before him
and said, &ldquo;You have been good to us. If ever you are in
trouble, think of me and we will come to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son thanked him, mounted his horse and continued
his journey. He rode on and on till he came to
another jungle, and there he saw a tiger who had a thorn in
his foot, and was roaring loudly from the pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you roar like that?&rdquo; said the young R&aacute;j&aacute;.
&ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have had a thorn in my
foot for twelve years,&rdquo; answered the tiger, &ldquo;and it hurts me
so; that is why I roar.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;I will
take it out for you. But, perhaps, as you are a tiger, when
I have made you well, you will eat me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said
the tiger, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t eat you. Do make me well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the prince took a little knife from his pocket, and
cut the thorn out of the tiger&rsquo;s foot; but when he cut, the
tiger roared louder than ever, so loud that his wife heard
him in the next jungle, and came bounding along to see
what was the matter. The tiger saw her coming, and hid
the prince in the jungle, so that she should not see him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What man hurt you that you roared so loud?&rdquo; said the
wife. &ldquo;No one hurt me,&rdquo; answered her husband; &ldquo;but a
R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son came and took the thorn out of my foot.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Where is he? Show him to me,&rdquo; said his wife. &ldquo;If you
promise not to kill him, I will call him,&rdquo; said the tiger. &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t kill him; only let me see him,&rdquo; answered his wife.</p>

<p>Then the tiger called the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son, and when he came
the tiger and his wife made him a great many salaams.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
Then they gave him a good dinner, and he stayed with them
for three days. Every day he looked at the tiger&rsquo;s foot, and
the third day it was quite healed. Then he said good-bye
to the tigers, and the tiger said to him, &ldquo;If ever you are in
trouble, think of me, and we will come to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son rode on and on till he came to a third
jungle. Here he found four fak&iacute;rs whose teacher and master
had died, and had left four things,&mdash;a bed, which carried
whoever sat on it whithersoever he wished to go; a bag, that
gave its owner whatever he wanted, jewels, food, or clothes;
a stone bowl that gave its owner as much water as he wanted,
no matter how far he might be from a tank; and a stick and
rope, to which its owner had only to say, if any one came to
make war on him, &ldquo;Stick, beat as many men and soldiers
as are here,&rdquo; and the stick would beat them and the rope
would tie them up.</p>

<p>The four fak&iacute;rs were quarrelling over these four things.
One said, &ldquo;I want this;&rdquo; another said, &ldquo;You cannot have
it, for I want it;&rdquo; and so on.</p>

<p>The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son said to them, &ldquo;Do not quarrel for these
things. I will shoot four arrows in four different directions.
Whichever of you gets to my first arrow, shall have the first
thing&mdash;the bed. Whosoever gets to the second arrow, shall
have the second thing&mdash;the bag. He who gets to the third
arrow, shall have the third thing&mdash;the bowl. And he who
gets to the fourth arrow, shall have the last things&mdash;the stick
and rope.&rdquo; To this they agreed, and the prince shot off his
first arrow. Away raced the fak&iacute;rs to get it. When they
brought it back to him he shot off the second, and when they
had found and brought it to him he shot off his third, and
when they had brought him the third he shot off the fourth.</p>

<p>While they were away looking for the fourth arrow, the
R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son let his horse loose in the jungle, and sat on the
bed, taking the bowl, the stick and rope, and the bag with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
him. Then he said, &ldquo;Bed, I wish to go to the Princess
Lab&aacute;m&rsquo;s country.&rdquo; The little bed instantly rose up into the
air and began to fly, and it flew and flew till it came to the
Princess Lab&aacute;m&rsquo;s country, where it settled on the ground.
The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son asked some men he saw, &ldquo;Whose country
is this?&rdquo; &ldquo;The Princess Lab&aacute;m&rsquo;s country,&rdquo; they answered.
Then the prince went on till he came to a house where he
saw an old woman. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Where
do you come from?&rdquo; &ldquo;I come from a far country,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;do let me stay with you to-night.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;I cannot let you stay with me; for our king has ordered
that men from other countries may not stay in his country.
You cannot stay in my house.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are my aunty,&rdquo; said the
prince; &ldquo;let me remain with you for this one night. You
see it is evening, and if I go into the jungle, then the wild
beasts will eat me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;you
may stay here to-night; but to-morrow morning you must
go away, for if the king hears you have passed the night in
my house, he will have me seized and put into prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she took him into her house, and the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son was
very glad. The old woman began preparing dinner, but he
stopped her. &ldquo;Aunty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will give you food.&rdquo;
He put his hand into his bag, saying, &ldquo;Bag, I want some
dinner,&rdquo; and the bag gave him instantly a delicious dinner,
served upon two gold plates. The old woman and the
R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son then dined together.</p>

<p>When they had finished eating, the old woman said,
&ldquo;Now I will fetch some water.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said the
prince. &ldquo;You shall have plenty of water directly.&rdquo; So he
took his bowl and said to it, &ldquo;Bowl, I want some water,&rdquo;
and then it filled with water. When it was full, the prince
cried out, &ldquo;Stop, bowl,&rdquo; and the bowl stopped filling. &ldquo;See,
aunty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with this bowl I can always get as much
water as I want.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
By this time night had come. &ldquo;Aunty,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s
son, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you light a lamp?&rdquo; &ldquo;There is no need,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Our king has forbidden the people in his country
to light any lamps; for, as soon as it is dark, his daughter,
the Princess Lab&aacute;m, comes and sits on her roof, and she
shines so, that she lights up all the country and our houses,
and we can see to do our work as if it were day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When it was quite black night, the princess got up. She
dressed herself in her rich clothes and jewels, and rolled up
her hair, and across her head she put a band of diamonds
and pearls. Then she shone like the moon, and her beauty
made night day. She came out of her room, and sat on the
roof of her palace. In the daytime she never came out of
her house; she only came out at night. All the people in
her father&rsquo;s country then went about their work and finished
it.</p>

<p>The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son watched the princess quietly, and was
very happy. He said to himself, &ldquo;How lovely she is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At midnight, when everybody had gone to bed, the princess
came down from her roof, and went to her room; and
when she was in bed and asleep, the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son got up softly,
and sat on his bed. &ldquo;Bed,&rdquo; he said to it, &ldquo;I want to go to
the Princess Lab&aacute;m&rsquo;s bed-room.&rdquo; So the little bed carried
him to the room where she lay fast asleep.</p>

<p>The young R&aacute;j&aacute; took his bag and said, &ldquo;I want a
great deal of betel-leaf,&rdquo; and it at once gave him quantities
of betel-leaf. This he laid near the princess&rsquo;s bed, and
then his little bed carried him back to the old woman&rsquo;s
house.</p>

<p>Next morning all the princess&rsquo;s servants found the betel-leaf,
and began to eat it. &ldquo;Where did you get all that betel-leaf?&rdquo;
asked the princess. &ldquo;We found it near your bed,&rdquo;
answered the servants. Nobody knew the prince had come
in the night and put it all there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
In the morning the old woman came to the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son.
&ldquo;Now it is morning,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you must go; for if
the king finds out all I have done for you, he will seize me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am ill to-day, dear aunty,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;do let me
stay till to-morrow morning.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the old woman.
So he stayed, and they took their dinner out of the bag, and
the bowl gave them water.</p>

<p>When night came the princess got up and sat on her roof,
and at twelve o&rsquo;clock, when every one was in bed, she went
to her bed-room, and was soon fast asleep. Then the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s
son sat on his bed, and it carried him to the princess. He
took his bag and said, &ldquo;Bag, I want a most lovely shawl.&rdquo;
It gave him a splendid shawl, and he spread it over the
princess as she lay asleep. Then he went back to the old
woman&rsquo;s house and slept till morning.</p>

<p>In the morning, when the princess saw the shawl, she was
delighted. &ldquo;See, mother,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;God must have
given me this shawl, it is so beautiful.&rdquo; Her mother was
very glad too. &ldquo;Yes, my child,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;God must
have given you this splendid shawl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When it was morning the old woman said to the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s
son, &ldquo;Now you must really go.&rdquo; &ldquo;Aunty,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;I am not well enough yet. Let me stay a few days longer.
I will remain hidden in your house, so that no one may see
me.&rdquo; So the old woman let him stay.</p>

<p>When it was black night, the princess put on her lovely
clothes and jewels, and sat on her roof. At midnight she went
to her room and went to sleep. Then the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son sat on
his bed and flew to her bed-room. There he said to his bag,
&ldquo;Bag, I want a very, very beautiful ring.&rdquo; The bag gave him a
glorious ring. Then he took the Princess Lab&aacute;m&rsquo;s hand gently
to put on the ring, and she started up very much frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she said to the prince. &ldquo;Where do you
come from? Why do you come to my room?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
be afraid, princess,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am no thief. I am a great
R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son. H&iacute;r&aacute;man parrot, who lives in the jungle where
I went to hunt, told me your name, and then I left my
father and mother, and came to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;as you are the son of such a
great R&aacute;j&aacute;, I will not have you killed, and I will tell my
father and mother that I wish to marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince then returned to the old woman&rsquo;s house; and
when morning came, the princess said to her mother, &ldquo;The
son of a great R&aacute;j&aacute; has come to this country, and I wish to
marry him.&rdquo; Her mother told this to the king. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo;
said the king; &ldquo;but if this R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son wishes to marry my
daughter, he must first do whatever I bid him. If he fails
I will kill him. I will give him eighty pounds weight of
mustard seed, and out of this he must crush the oil in one
day. If he cannot do this he shall die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the morning the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son told the old woman that he
intended to marry the princess. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the old woman,
&ldquo;go away from this country, and do not think of marrying
her. A great many R&aacute;j&aacute;s and R&aacute;j&aacute;s&rsquo; sons have come here
to marry her, and her father has had them all killed. He
says whoever wishes to marry his daughter must first do
whatever he bids him. If he can, then he shall marry the
princess; if he cannot, the king will have him killed. But
no one can do the things the king tells him to do; so all
the R&aacute;j&aacute;s and R&aacute;j&aacute;s&rsquo; sons who have tried have been put to
death. You will be killed too, if you try. Do go away.&rdquo;
But the prince would not listen to anything she said.</p>

<p>The king sent for the prince to the old woman&rsquo;s house,
and his servants brought the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son to the king&rsquo;s court-house
to the king. There the king gave him eighty pounds
of mustard seed, and told him to crush all the oil out of it
that day, and bring it next morning to him to the court-house.
&ldquo;Whoever wishes to marry my daughter,&rdquo; he said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
to the prince, &ldquo;must first do all I tell him. If he cannot,
then I have him killed. So if you cannot crush all the oil
out of this mustard seed, you will die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince was very sorry when he heard this. &ldquo;How
can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day?&rdquo;
he said to himself; &ldquo;and if I do not, the king will kill me.&rdquo;
He took the mustard seed to the old woman&rsquo;s house, and
did not know what to do. At last he remembered the Ant-R&aacute;j&aacute;,
and the moment he did so, the Ant-R&aacute;j&aacute; and his ants
came to him. &ldquo;Why do you look so sad?&rdquo; said the Ant-R&aacute;j&aacute;.
The prince showed him the mustard seed, and said
to him, &ldquo;How can I crush the oil out of all this mustard
seed in one day? And if I do not take the oil to the king
to-morrow morning, he will kill me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be happy,&rdquo; said the
Ant-R&aacute;j&aacute;; &ldquo;lie down and sleep: we will crush all the oil
out for you during the day, and to-morrow morning you shall
take it to the king.&rdquo; The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son lay down and slept, and
the ants crushed out the oil for him. The prince was very
glad when he saw the oil.</p>

<p>The next morning he took it to the court-house to the
king. But the king said, &ldquo;You cannot yet marry my
daughter. If you wish to do so, you must first fight with my
two demons and kill them.&rdquo; The king a long time ago had
caught two demons, and then, as he did not know what to do
with them, he had shut them up in a cage. He was afraid
to let them loose for fear they would eat up all the people
in his country; and he did not know how to kill them. So
all the kings and kings&rsquo; sons who wanted to marry the
Princess Lab&aacute;m had to fight with these demons; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said
the king to himself, &ldquo;perhaps the demons may be killed,
and then I shall be rid of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he heard of the demons the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son was very
sad. &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;How can I
fight with these two demons?&rdquo; Then he thought of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
tiger: and the tiger and his wife came to him and said,
&ldquo;Why are you so sad?&rdquo; The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son answered, &ldquo;The
king has ordered me to fight with his two demons and kill
them. How can I do this?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not be frightened,&rdquo; said
the tiger. &ldquo;Be happy. I and my wife will fight with them
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son took out of his bag two splendid
coats. They were all gold and silver, and covered with
pearls and diamonds. These he put on the tigers to make
them beautiful, and he took them to the king, and said to
him, &ldquo;May these tigers fight your demons for me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said the king, who did not care in the least who killed his
demons, provided they were killed. &ldquo;Then call your demons,&rdquo;
said the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;and these tigers will fight them.&rdquo; The
king did so, and the tigers and the demons fought and fought
until the tigers had killed the demons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;But you must do something
else before I give you my daughter. Up in the sky
I have a kettle-drum. You must go and beat it. If you
cannot do this, I will kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son thought of his little bed; so he went to
the old woman&rsquo;s house and sat on his bed. &ldquo;Little bed,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;up in the sky is the king&rsquo;s kettle-drum. I want
to go to it.&rdquo; The bed flew up with him, and the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son
beat the drum, and the king heard him. Still, when he
came down, the king would not give him his daughter.
&ldquo;You have,&rdquo; he said to the prince, &ldquo;done the three things
I told you to do; but you must do one thing more.&rdquo; &ldquo;If
I can, I will,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p>Then the king showed him the trunk of a tree that was
lying near his court-house. It was a very, very thick trunk.
He gave the prince a wax hatchet, and said, &ldquo;To-morrow
morning you must cut this trunk in two with this wax hatchet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son went back to the old woman&rsquo;s house. He
was very sad, and thought that now the R&aacute;j&aacute; would certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
kill him. &ldquo;I had his oil crushed out by the ants,&rdquo; he said
to himself. &ldquo;I had his demons killed by the tigers. My
bed helped me to beat his kettle-drum. But now what can
I do? How can I cut that thick tree trunk in two with a
wax hatchet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At night he went on his bed to see the princess. &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo;
he said to her, &ldquo;your father will kill me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
asked the princess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has told me to cut a thick tree-trunk in two with a
wax hatchet. How can I ever do that?&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son.
&ldquo;Do not be afraid,&rdquo; said the princess; &ldquo;do as I bid you, and
you will cut it in two quite easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she pulled out a hair from her head, and gave it to
the prince. &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when no one is near
you, you must say to the tree-trunk, &lsquo;The Princess Lab&aacute;m
commands you to let yourself be cut in two by this hair.&rsquo;
Then stretch the hair down the edge of the wax hatchet&rsquo;s
blade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince next day did exactly as the princess had told
him; and the minute the hair that was stretched down the
edge of the hatchet-blade touched the tree-trunk, it split into
two pieces.</p>

<p>The king said, &ldquo;Now you can marry my daughter.&rdquo; Then
the wedding took place. All the R&aacute;j&aacute;s and kings of the
countries round were asked to come to it, and there were
great rejoicings. After a few days the prince&rsquo;s son said to
his wife, &ldquo;Let us go to my father&rsquo;s country.&rdquo; The Princess
Lab&aacute;m&rsquo;s father gave them a quantity of camels and horses
and rupees and servants; and they travelled in great state to
the prince&rsquo;s country, where they lived happily.</p>

<p>The prince always kept his bag, bowl, bed, and stick; only
as no one ever came to make war on him, he never needed
to use the stick.</p>

THE PRINCESS WHO LOVED HER FATHER
LIKE SALT.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxxiii">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapi"><span class="dcap">I</span></span>N a country there lived a king who had seven daughters.
One day he called them all to him and said to them,
&ldquo;My daughters, how much do you love me?&rdquo; The
six eldest answered, &ldquo;Father, we love you as much as sweetmeats
and sugar;&rdquo; but the seventh and youngest daughter
said, &ldquo;Father, I love you as much as salt.&rdquo; The king was
much pleased with his six eldest daughters, but very angry
with his youngest daughter. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;my
daughter only loves me as much as she does salt!&rdquo; Then
he called some of his servants, and said to them, &ldquo;Get a
palanquin ready, and carry my youngest daughter away to
the jungle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servants did as they were bid; and when they got to
the jungle, they put the palanquin down under a tree and
went away. The princess called to them, &ldquo;Where are you
going? Stay here; my father did not tell you to leave me
alone in the jungle.&rdquo; &ldquo;We will come back,&rdquo; said the servants;
&ldquo;we are only going to drink some water.&rdquo; But they returned
to her father&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>The princess waited in the palanquin under the tree, and
it was now evening, and the servants had not come back.
She was very much frightened and cried bitterly. &ldquo;The
tigers and wild beasts will eat me,&rdquo; she said to herself. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
last she went to sleep, and slept for a little while. When she
awoke she found in her palanquin some food on a plate,
and a little water, that God had sent her while she slept.
She ate the food and drank the water, and then she felt
happier, for she thought, &ldquo;God must have sent me this food
and water.&rdquo; She decided that as it was now night she had
better stay in her palanquin, and go to sleep. &ldquo;Perhaps the
tigers and wild beasts will come and eat me,&rdquo; she thought;
&ldquo;but if they don&rsquo;t, I will try to-morrow to get out of this
jungle, and go to another country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning she left her palanquin and set out. She
walked on, till, deep in the jungle, she came to a beautiful
palace, which did not belong to her father, but to another
king. The gate was shut, but she opened it, and went in.
She looked all about, and thought, &ldquo;What a beautiful house
this is, and what a pretty garden and tank!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everything was beautiful, only there were no servants nor
anybody else to be seen. She went into the house, and
through all the rooms. In one room she saw a dinner ready
to be eaten, but there was no one to eat it. At last she
came to a room in which was a splendid bed, and on it lay
a king&rsquo;s son covered with a shawl. She took the shawl off,
and then she saw he was very beautiful, and that he was
dead. His body was stuck full of needles.</p>

<p>She sat down on the bed, and there she sat for one week,
without eating, or drinking, or sleeping, pulling out the
needles. Then a man came by who said to her, &ldquo;I have
here a girl I wish to sell.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have no rupees,&rdquo; said the
princess; &ldquo;but if you will sell her to me for my gold bangles,
I will buy her.&rdquo; The man took the bangles, and left the
girl with the princess, who was very glad to have her. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo;
she thought, &ldquo;I shall be no longer alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All day and all night long the princess sat and pulled out
the needles, while the girl went about the palace doing other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
work. At the end of other two weeks the princess had
pulled out all the needles from the king&rsquo;s body, except those
in his eyes.</p>

<p>Then the king&rsquo;s daughter said to her servant-girl, &ldquo;For
three weeks I have not bathed. Get a bath ready for me,
and while I am bathing sit by the king, but do not take the
needles out of his eyes. I will pull them out myself.&rdquo; The
servant-girl promised not to pull out the needles. Then she
got the bath ready; but when the king&rsquo;s daughter had gone
to bathe, she sat down on the bed, and pulled the needles
out of the king&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>As soon as she had done so, he opened his eyes, and sat
up. He thanked God for bringing him to life again. Then
he looked about, and saw the servant-girl, and said to her,
&ldquo;Who has made me well and pulled all the needles out of
my body?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; she answered. Then he thanked
her and said she should be his wife.</p>

<p>When the princess came from her bath, she found the
king alive, and sitting on his bed talking to her servant.
When she saw this she was very sad, but she said nothing.
The king said to the servant-maid, &ldquo;Who is this girl?&rdquo; She
answered, &ldquo;She is one of my servants.&rdquo; And from that
moment the princess became a servant-girl, and her servant-girl
married the king. Every day the king said, &ldquo;Can this
lovely girl be really a servant? She is far more beautiful
than my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day the king thought, &ldquo;I will go to another country
to eat the air.&rdquo; So he called the pretended princess, his wife,
and told her he was going to eat the air in another country.
&ldquo;What would you like me to bring you when I come back?&rdquo;
She answered, &ldquo;I should like beautiful s&aacute;r&iacute;s and clothes, and
gold and silver jewels.&rdquo; Then the king said, &ldquo;Call the
servant-girl, and ask her what she would like me to bring
her.&rdquo; The real princess came, and the king said to her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
&ldquo;See, I am going to another country to eat the air. What
would you like me to bring for you when I return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;King,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;if you can bring me what I want
I will tell you what it is; but if you cannot get it, I will not
tell you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell me what it is,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Whatever
it may be I will bring it you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the princess.
&ldquo;I want a sun-jewel box.&rdquo; Now the princess knew all about
the sun-jewel boxes, and that only fairies had such boxes.
And she knew, too, what would be in hers if the king could
get one for her, although these boxes contain sometimes one
thing and sometimes another.</p>

<p>The king had never heard of such a box, and did not
know what it was like; so he went to every country asking
all the people he met what sort of box was a sun-jewel box,
and where he could get it. At last one day, after a fruitless
search, he was very sad, for he thought, &ldquo;I have promised
the servant to bring her a sun-jewel box, and now I cannot
get one for her; what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he went to sleep, and had a dream. In it he saw a
jungle, and in the jungle a fak&iacute;r who, when he slept, slept for
twelve years, and then was awake for twelve years. The
king felt sure this man could give him what he wanted, so
when he woke he said to his sepoys and servants, &ldquo;Stay
here in this spot till I return to you; then we will go back
to my country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He mounted his horse and set out for the jungle he had
seen in his dream. He went on and on till he came to it,
and there he saw the fak&iacute;r lying asleep. He had been asleep
for twelve years all but two weeks: over him were a quantity
of leaves, and grass, and a great deal of mud. The king
began taking off all the grass, and leaves, and mud, and
every day for a fortnight when he got up he cleared them all
away from off the fak&iacute;r. When the fak&iacute;r awoke at the end
of the two weeks, and saw that no mud, or grass, or leaves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
were upon him, but that he was quite clean, he was very
much pleased, and said to the king, &ldquo;I have slept for twelve
years, and yet I am as clean as I was when I went to sleep.
When I awoke after my last sleep, I was all covered with dirt
and mud, grass and leaves; but this time I am quite clean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king stayed with the fak&iacute;r for a week, and waited on
him and did everything for him. The fak&iacute;r was very much
pleased with the king, and he told this to him: &ldquo;You are
a very good man.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;Why did you come to this
jungle? You are such a great king, what can you want
from me?&rdquo; &ldquo;I want a sun-jewel box,&rdquo; answered the king.
&ldquo;You are such a good man,&rdquo; said the fak&iacute;r, &ldquo;that I will
give you one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the fak&iacute;r went to a beautiful well, down which he
went right to the bottom. There, there was a house in which
lived the red fairy. She was called the red fairy not because
her skin was red, for it was quite white, but because everything
about her was red&mdash;her house, her clothes, and her
country. She was very glad to see the fak&iacute;r, and asked him
why he had come to see her. &ldquo;I want you to give me a
sun-jewel box,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the fairy,
and she brought him one in which were seven small dolls
and a little flute. &ldquo;No one but she who wants this box must
open it,&rdquo; said the fairy to the fak&iacute;r. &ldquo;She must open it
when she is quite alone and at night.&rdquo; Then she told him
what was in the box.</p>

<p>The fak&iacute;r thanked her, and took the box to the king, who
was delighted and made many salaams to the fak&iacute;r. The fak&iacute;r
told him none but the person who wished for the box was to
open it; but he did not tell him what more the fairy had
said.</p>

<p>The king set off on his journey now, and when he came
to his servants and sepoys, he said to them he would now
return to his country, as he had found the box he wanted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
When he reached his palace he called the false princess, his
wife, and gave her her silks and shawls, and s&aacute;r&iacute;s, and gold
and silver jewels. Then he called the servant-girl&mdash;the true
princess&mdash;and gave her her sun-jewel box. She took it, and
was delighted to have it. She made him many salaams and
went away with her box, but did not open it then, for she
knew what was in it, and that she must open it at night and
alone.</p>

<p>That night she took her box and went out all by herself
to a wide plain in the jungle, and there opened it. She took
the little flute, put it to her lips, and began to play, and
instantly out flew the seven little dolls, who were all little
fairies, and they took chairs and carpets from the box, and
arranged them all in a large tent which appeared at that
moment. Then the fairies bathed her, combed and rolled
up her hair, put on her grand clothes and lovely slippers.
But all the time the princess did nothing but cry. They
brought a chair and placed it before the tent, and made her
sit in it. One of them took the flute and played on it, and
all the others danced before the princess, and they sang
songs for her. Still she cried and cried. At last, at four
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, one of the fairies said, &ldquo;Princess,
why do you cry?&rdquo; &ldquo;I took all the needles out of the king,
all but those in his eyes,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;and while I
was bathing, my servant-girl, whom I had bought with my
gold bangles, pulled these out. She told the king it was she
who had pulled out all the other needles and brought him to
life, and that I was her servant, and she has taken my place
and is treated as the princess, and the king has married her,
while I am made to do a servant&rsquo;s work and treated as the
servant.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not cry,&rdquo; said the fairies. &ldquo;Everything
will be well for you by and by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When it was close on morning, the princess played on the
flute, and all the chairs, sofas, and fairies became quite tiny,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
and went into the box, and the tent disappeared. She shut
it up, and took it back to the king&rsquo;s palace. The next night
she again went out to the jungle-plain, and all happened as
on the night before.</p>

<p>A wood-cutter was coming home late from his work, and
had to pass by the plain. He wondered when he saw the
tent. &ldquo;I went by some time ago,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;and
I saw no tent here.&rdquo; He climbed up a big tree to see what
was going on, and saw the fairies dancing before the princess,
who sat outside the tent, and he saw how she cried
though the fairies did all they could to amuse her. Then
he heard the fairies say, &ldquo;Princess, why do you cry?&rdquo; And
he heard her tell them how she had cured the king, and
how her servant-girl had taken her place and made her a
servant. &ldquo;Never mind, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; said the fairies. &ldquo;All
will be well by and by.&rdquo; Near morning the princess played
on her flute, and the fairies went into the box, and the tent
disappeared, and the princess went back to the palace.</p>

<p>The third night passed as the other two had done. The
wood-cutter came to look on, and climbed into the tree to
see the fairies and the princess. Again the fairies asked her
why she cried, and she gave the same answer.</p>

<p>The next day the wood-cutter went to the king. &ldquo;Last
night and the night before,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as I came home from
work, I saw a large tent in the jungle, and before the tent
there sat a princess who did nothing but cry, while seven
fairies danced before her, or played on different instruments,
and sang songs to her.&rdquo; The king was very much astonished,
and said to the wood-cutter, &ldquo;To-night I will go with
you, and see the tent, and the princess, and the fairies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When it was night the princess went out softly and opened
her box on the plain. The wood-cutter fetched the king,
and the two men climbed into a tree, and watched the fairies
as they danced and sang. The king saw that the princess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
who sat and cried was his own servant-girl. He heard her
tell the fairies all she had done for him, and all that had
happened to her; so he came suddenly down from the tree,
and went up to her, and took her hand. &ldquo;I always thought
you were a princess, and no servant-girl,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will
you marry me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She left off crying, and said, &ldquo;Yes, I will marry you.&rdquo;
She played on her flute, and the tent disappeared, and all
the fairies, and sofas, and chairs went into the box. She put
her flute in it, as she always did before shutting down the
lid, and went home with the king.</p>

<p>The servant-girl was very vexed and angry when she
found the king knew all that had happened. However, the
princess was most good to her, and never treated her
unkindly.</p>

<p>The princess then sent a letter to her mother, in which
she wrote, &ldquo;I am going to be married to a great king. You
and my father must come to my wedding, and must bring
my sisters with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all came, and her father and mother liked the king
very much, and were glad their daughter should marry him.
The wedding took place, and they stayed with her for some
time. For a whole week she gave their servants and sepoys
nice food cooked with salt, but to her father and mother
and sisters she only gave food cooked with sugar. At last
they got so tired of this sweet food that they could eat it no
longer. At the end of the week she gave them a dinner
cooked with salt. Then her father said, &ldquo;My daughter is
wise though she is so young, and is the youngest of my
daughters. I know now how much she loved me when she
said she loved me like salt. People cannot eat their food
without salt. If their food is cooked with sugar one
day, it must be cooked with salt the next, or they cannot
eat it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
After this her father and mother and sisters went home,
but they often came to see their little daughter and her
husband.</p>

<p>The princess, the king, and the servant-maid all lived
happily together.</p>

<h2><a name="sxxiv" id="sxxiv"></a>XXIV.<br />
<br />
THE DEMON IS AT LAST CONQUERED BY THE
KING&rsquo;S SON.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxxiv">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapi"><span class="dcap">I</span></span>N a country there were seven men, no two of whom
belonged to the same family, or were of the same
trade. One was a grain merchant&rsquo;s son, one a
baker&rsquo;s, and so on; each had a different trade.</p>

<p>These seven men determined they would go to seek for
service in another country. They said good-bye to their
fathers and mothers, and set off.</p>

<p>They travelled every day, and walked through many
jungles. At last, a long way from their homes, they came
to a wide plain in the midst of a jungle, and on it they saw
a goat which seemed to be a very good milch-goat. The
seven men said to each other, &ldquo;If this goat belonged to any
one, it would not be left all alone in the jungle. Let us
take it with us.&rdquo; They did so, and no one they met asked
them any questions about the goat.</p>

<p>In the evening they arrived at a village where they stayed
for the night. They cooked and ate their dinners, and gave
the goat grass and grain. At midnight, when they were all
asleep, the goat became a great she-demon, with a great
mouth, and swallowed one of the seven men. Then she
became a goat again, and went back to the place where she
had been stabled.</p>

<p>The men got up in the morning, and were very much
surprised to find they were only six, not seven. &ldquo;Where is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
the seventh gone?&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Well, when he returns we
will all go on together.&rdquo; They sat waiting and waiting for
him, till, as it was getting late and he had not come, they
all thought they had better start without him. So they continued
their journey, taking the goat with them. Before they
went they said to the villagers, &ldquo;If our seventh man comes
back to you, send him after us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At evening they came to another village, where they stayed
for the night. They cooked and ate their dinners, and gave
grain and grass to the goat. At midnight, when they were
fast asleep, the goat became a demon and swallowed another
man, and then took her goat&rsquo;s shape again.</p>

<p>In this way she ate five men. The two that were left were
very sad at finding themselves alone. &ldquo;We were seven
men,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;now we are but two.&rdquo; The grain merchant&rsquo;s
son was one of the two, and he was very quick and
sharp. He determined he would not say anything to his
companion, but that he would watch by him that night, and
find out, if he could, what had happened to his other friends.
To keep himself awake he cut a piece out of his finger, and
rubbed a little salt into the wound, so that when his companion
went to sleep, he should not be able to sleep because
of the pain. At midnight the goat came and turned into a
huge demon. She went quickly up to the sleeping man to
swallow him; but the merchant&rsquo;s son rushed at her, beat
her, and snatched his companion from her mouth. The
demon turned instantly into a goat, and went back to the
place where it had been stabled.</p>

<p>The two men next morning set out from the village where
they had passed the night. They would have killed the goat
had they been able. As they could not do so, they took
it with them till they came to a plain in the jungle, where
they tied it up to a tree, and left it. Then they continued
their journey, and were very sorry they had not known how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
wicked the goat was before it had swallowed their five companions.</p>

<p>The goat meanwhile turned itself into a most beautiful
young girl, dressed in grand clothes and rich jewels, and
she sat down in the jungle and began to cry. Just then
the king of another country was hunting in this jungle; and
when he heard the noise of the crying, he called his servants
and told them to go and see who was crying. The servants
looked about until they saw the beautiful girl. They asked
her a great many questions, but she only cried, and would
not answer. The servants returned to the king, and told
him it was a most beautiful young girl who was crying; but
she would do nothing but cry, and would not speak.</p>

<p>The king left his hunting and went himself to the girl,
and asked her why she cried. &ldquo;My husband married me,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and was taking me to his home. He went to
get some water to drink, and left me here. He has never
come back, and I don&rsquo;t know where he is; perhaps some
tiger has killed him, and now I am all alone, and do not
know where to go. This is why I cry.&rdquo; The king was so
delighted with her beauty, that he asked her to go with him.
He sent his servants for a fine palanquin, and when it came
he put the girl into it, and took her to his palace, and there
she stayed.</p>

<p>At midnight she turned into a demon, and went to the
place where the king&rsquo;s sheep and goats were kept. She
tore open all their stomachs, and ate all their hearts. Then
she dipped seven knives in their blood, and laid the knives
on the beds of the seven queens.</p>

<p>Next morning the king heard that all his sheep and
goats were lying dead; and when his seven wives woke,
they saw that their clothes were all bloody, and that bloody
knives lay on their beds. They wondered who had done
this wicked thing to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
The next night at twelve o&rsquo;clock the beautiful girl turned
into a demon again, and went to the cow-house. There she
tore open the cows and ate their hearts. Then she smeared
the queens&rsquo; clothes, and laid knives dipped in blood on their
beds; but she washed her own hands and clothes, so that
no blood should show on them. For a long time the same
thing happened every night, till she had eaten all the elephants,
horses, camels,&mdash;every animal, indeed, belonging to
the king. The king wondered very much at his animals all
being killed in this way, and he could not understand either
why every morning his wives&rsquo; clothes were bloody, and
bloody knives found on their beds.</p>

<p>When she had eaten all the animals, the demon said to
the king, &ldquo;I am afraid your wives are very wicked women.
They must have killed all your cows and sheep, goats,
horses, elephants, and camels. I am afraid one day they
will eat me up.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have been married to them for many
years,&rdquo; answered the king, &ldquo;and anything like this has never
happened before.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am very much afraid of them,&rdquo; said
the demon, who all this time looked a most beautiful girl.
&ldquo;I am very much afraid; but if you cut out their eyes, then
they cannot kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king called his servants and said to them, &ldquo;Get
ready seven palanquins, and carry my seven wives into the
jungle. There you must leave them; only first take out
their eyes, which you must bring to me.&rdquo; The servants took
the queens to a jungle a long way from the king&rsquo;s country.
There they took out their eyes, and left them, and brought
the eyes to the king, who gave them into the demon&rsquo;s
hands. She pounded them to bits with a stone, and threw
the bits away.</p>

<p>The seven queens in the jungle did not know which way
to go; so they walked straight on, and fell into a dry well
which lay just before them. In this well they stayed; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
the day when they thought they must die of hunger and
thirst was drawing near. But before it came the eldest queen
had a little son. She and the five next wives were so hungry,
that they agreed to kill the child, and divide it into seven
pieces. They each ate a piece, and gave one to the seventh
and youngest wife. She said nothing, and hid the piece.
These five wives each had a son one after the other, and
they killed and divided their children as the eldest wife had
done with hers. But the youngest wife hid all the six pieces
that were given her, and would eat none. Her son was born
last of all. Then the six eldest wives said, &ldquo;Let us kill and
divide your child.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will never kill or
divide my boy; I would rather die of hunger. Here are the
six pieces you gave me. I would not eat them. Take them
and eat them, but you must not touch my son.&rdquo; God was
so pleased with her for not killing her child, that he made
the boy grow bigger and bigger every day; and the little
queen was very happy.</p>

<p>They all lived in the dry well without any food till the
little prince was five years old. By that time he was very
quick and clever. One day he said to his mother, &ldquo;Why
have we lived all this while in the well?&rdquo; His mother and all
the other wives told him about the wicked demon who lived
in his father&rsquo;s palace, and how the king believed her to be
a beautiful girl and had married her, and of all the evil
things that she had done to them, and how she had made
the king send them to the jungle and have their eyes cut
out and given to her, and how from not being able to see
they had fallen into this well, and how they had eaten all
his brothers, because they were so very hungry they thought
they should die&mdash;all but his mother at least, for she would
not eat the other wives&rsquo; children and would not kill her own
little son. &ldquo;Let me climb out of this well,&rdquo; said the boy,
who determined in his heart that he would kill this wicked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
demon one day. His mother said, &ldquo;No, stay here; you
are too young to leave the well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy did not listen to her, but scrambled out. Then he
saw they were in a wide plain in the jungle. He ran after a
few birds, caught and killed them. Then he roasted the
birds and brought them with some water to his seven mothers
in the well. When they had eaten them and drunk the
water, they were happy and worshipped God. The six
mothers who had eaten their children were full of sorrow,
and said, &ldquo;If our six sons were now living, how good it
would be for us: how happy we should be.&rdquo; The young
prince went out hunting for little birds every day, and in the
evening he cooked those he caught and brought them, with
water, to his mothers.</p>

<p>Now the demon, because she was a demon and was therefore
wiser than men and women, knew that the seven queens
lived in the well, and that the son of the youngest queen was
still alive. She determined to kill him; so she pretended her
eyes hurt her, and began crying, and making a great to-do.
The king asked her, &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; &ldquo;See, king,
see my eyes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They ache and hurt me so much.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What medicine will make them well again?&rdquo; said the king.
&ldquo;If I could only bathe them with a tigress&rsquo;s milk, they would
be well,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>The king called two of his servants and said to them, &ldquo;Can
either of you get me a tigress&rsquo;s milk? Here are two thousand
rupees for whichever of you brings me the milk.&rdquo; Then he
gave them the rupees, and told them to get it at once.</p>

<p>The servants took the rupees, and said nothing to the
king, but they said to each other, &ldquo;How can we get a
tigress&rsquo;s milk?&rdquo; And they were very sad. They left the king&rsquo;s
country, and wandered on till they came to the jungle-plain,
where lived the young prince and his mothers. There they
saw him sitting by a dry well and roasting birds. &ldquo;Do you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
live in this jungle?&rdquo; they said to him. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the
boy. Then the servants talked together. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; they said,
&ldquo;this boy lives in the jungle, so he will surely be able to get
us the milk. Let us tell him to get it, and give him the two
thousand rupees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they came back to the boy, who asked them where they
were going. &ldquo;Our queen is very ill with pain in her eyes,
and our king has sent us for some tigress&rsquo;s milk for her to
bathe them with, that they may get well. He has given us
two thousand rupees, for whichever of us to keep who gets
the milk. But we do not know where or how to get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the boy; &ldquo;give me the two thousand rupees
and I will get it for you. Come here for it in a week&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s servants were very much pleased at not having
to try and get it themselves, so they gave him the rupees and
went home. The demon knew quite well when she asked for
the milk that none of the king&rsquo;s servants would dare to go for
it, but that his son would be brave enough to go. This is
why she asked for it, for she meant the tigers to kill him.</p>

<p>The little prince now took his seven mothers out of the
well, and they all went together to his father&rsquo;s country.
There he got a small house for them, and good clothes and
food. He got a servant, too, for them, to cook their dinner
and take care of them. &ldquo;Be very tender to them,&rdquo; he said
to the servant, &ldquo;for they cannot see.&rdquo; For himself he bought
a little horse, and good clothes, and a gun, and a sword.
Then he made his mothers many salaams, and told them he
was going to get a tigress&rsquo;s milk. They all cried and begged
him not to go.</p>

<p>But he set off and rode for three or four days through
the jungles. Then he came to a large jungle which was in
a great blaze, and two tiger-cubs were running about in the
jungle trying to get out of the fire. He jumped off his horse,
and took them in his hands; then he mounted his horse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
again and rode out of the jungle. He rode on till he came
to another which was not on fire. He let the cubs loose in
it that they might run away; but they placed themselves in
front of his horse, and said, &ldquo;We will not let you go till you
have seen our father and mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the tiger and tigress saw the boy coming with
their cubs, and they came running to meet them. Till then
they had thought their cubs were burned in the jungle-fire.
Now they knew at once this boy had saved them. The
cubs said to their father and mother, &ldquo;We should have died
had it not been for this boy. Give him food; and when he
has eaten some food, we will drink milk.&rdquo; The tigers were
very happy at having their children safe. They went to a
garden and got food and good water for the boy, who ate
and drank. Then the little cubs drank their mother&rsquo;s
milk.</p>

<p>The tiger said to the prince, &ldquo;You are such a little child,
how is it your mother let you come alone to this jungle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s eyes are sore and pain her; and the doctor
says that if she bathes them in a tigress&rsquo;s milk they will get
well. So I came to see if I could get a little for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give you some,&rdquo; said the tigress, and she gave him
a little jar full of her milk. The cubs said, &ldquo;One of us will go
with you, and the other will stay with our father and mother.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the little prince, &ldquo;do you both stay with your
father and mother. I will not take either of you away.
What should I do with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said one of the cubs;
&ldquo;I will go with you. I will do all you tell me. Wherever
you bid me stay, there I will stay; and I will eat any food
you give me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Take him with you,&rdquo; said the old tiger;
&ldquo;one day you will find him of use.&rdquo; So the boy took the
cub and the milk, and made his salaam to the old tigers
and went home. His mothers were delighted at his return,
though, as they had no eyes, they could not see him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
He tied up the tiger&rsquo;s cub and fed him. Then he took a
little of the milk, and went to the dry well in the jungle and
sat down by it. The king&rsquo;s servants came when the week
had passed, and the boy gave them the milk. The servants
took it to the king, who gave it to the demon. She was
very angry when she found the tigers had not eaten the boy;
but she bathed her eyes with the milk, and said nothing.</p>

<p>At the end of another week she would not eat or drink,
and did nothing but cry. &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said the
king. &ldquo;See how my eyes pain me,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;If I
could only get an eagle&rsquo;s feather to lay on them they would
be well. Oh, how they hurt me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king called his servants and gave them four thousand
rupees. &ldquo;Go and get me an eagle&rsquo;s feather,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
he who gets it is to take the four thousand rupees.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let
us go to the jungle well,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;and find the boy who
got us the tigress&rsquo;s milk. We could never get an eagle&rsquo;s
feather, but this child certainly can get one for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they went to the well where they found the boy. The
little prince was very wise, though he was such a little child;
and he knew the demon would try to send him on some
other errand that she might get rid of him. He was quite
willing to go on her errands, for he thought he might thus
learn how to kill her. He was not a bit afraid of being
killed himself, for he knew that God loved him, and that
no one but God could kill him.</p>

<p>He at once asked the king&rsquo;s servants, &ldquo;What do you want
now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Our king has sent us for an eagle&rsquo;s feather to lay
on the queen&rsquo;s eyes, which pain her again. Here are four
thousand rupees for you if you will get it for us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Give
me the rupees,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Come here in two
weeks, and I will give you the feather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took the rupees to his mothers, and told them he was
going to fetch an eagle&rsquo;s feather. &ldquo;Where will you find one?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
they said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I am going
to look for one.&rdquo; He hired some more servants, and told
them to take care of his mothers and the tiger-cub.</p>

<p>He rode straight on for two or three days, and at last
came to a very dense jungle, through which he rode for
another three or four days. When he got out of it he
found himself on a beautiful smooth plain in which was
a tank. There, too, was a large fig-tree, and under the tree
cool shade, and cool, thick grass. He was very much
pleased when he saw the tank and the tree. He got off his
horse, bathed in the tank, and sat down under the fig-tree,
thinking, &ldquo;Here I will sleep a little while before I go
further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While he lay asleep in the grass, a great snake crawled up
the tree, at the top of which were two young eagles. They
began screaming very loud. Their cries awakened the little
prince. He looked about and saw the great snake in the
tree. Then he took his gun and fired at it, and the snake
fell dead to the ground. He cut it into five pieces, and hid
them in the long grass. Then he lay down again and went
to sleep.</p>

<p>The baby eagles were alone in the tree, as their father and
mother had gone to another country. But now the old
birds came home, and found the king&rsquo;s son sleeping in the
grass. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;here is the thief who every year
robs us of our children! But now he cannot get away.
We will kill him.&rdquo; However, they thought it better to go
and look first at their children, to see if they were safe or not.
They flew up to the top of the tree, and when they found
their children safe, they wished to give them food. All the
time they kept saying, &ldquo;Eat; then we will kill the thief
who steals away our children every year.&rdquo; The young eagles
thought, &ldquo;Oh, if God would only give us the power to
speak, then we would tell our father and mother that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
boy is no thief.&rdquo; Then God gave them the power to speak,
and they said to the old eagles, &ldquo;Listen; if that boy had
not been here, we should have died, for he killed a huge
snake that was going to swallow us: only go and look, and
you will see it dead and cut into pieces.&rdquo; And the eaglets
refused to eat till the boy had been fed.</p>

<p>The big eagles flew down and found the bits of the snake:
so they flew away to a beautiful garden, where they got
delicious fruits and water. These they brought to the boy,
and awoke him and fed him. Then they said to him, &ldquo;It
is indeed good to find our children alive. Hitherto our
children have always been eaten by that snake. How are
your father and mother? Why did they let you come to
this jungle? What have you come here for?&rdquo; The little
prince said, &ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s eyes are very sore; but they
would be cured if she could have an eagle&rsquo;s feather to lay
on them. So I came to look for one.&rdquo; Then the mother
gave him one of her feathers.</p>

<p>When the boy was going home, the eaglets said they
would go with him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will not take you
with me.&rdquo; But the old birds said, &ldquo;Take one of them, it
will help you one day.&rdquo; The little prince made his salaam
to the big eagles, and took one of their young ones, mounted
his horse, and rode off. The eaglet flew over his head to
shade him from the sun.</p>

<p>When he got home to his seven mothers, he took the
feather and went and sat by the dry well. The king&rsquo;s
servants came there to him, and he gave them the feather,
and said, &ldquo;Take it to your king.&rdquo; This they did, and the
king gave it to the demon, who flew into a great rage. She
said to herself, &ldquo;The tigers did not kill him, and now the
eagles have not killed him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end of two weeks she began to cry and would not
eat. The king asked her, &ldquo;What is the matter with you?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
what has happened to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;My eyes pain me so much,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;What will cure them?&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;If
I had only some night-growing rice,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I would boil
it, and make rice-water, which I would drink. Then I should
get well.&rdquo; Now this night-growing rice was a wonderful
rice that no men, and only one demon, possessed. This was
the demon-queen&rsquo;s brother. He used to put a grain of this
rice into his huge cavern of a mouth at night when he went
to sleep, and when he woke in the morning this grain would
have become a tree. Then the demon used to take the
rice-tree out of his mouth.</p>

<p>The demon, who seemed such a lovely girl, now wrote a
letter to her brother, in which she said, &ldquo;The bearer of this
letter goes to you for some night-growing rice. You must
kill him at once; you must not let him live.&rdquo; The king gave
this letter to his servants, with six thousand rupees. &ldquo;Take
this letter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and fetch some of the night-growing
rice. Here are six thousand rupees for whichever of you
finds it.&rdquo; The king had no idea that it was not these men
who had gone for the tigress&rsquo;s milk and the eagle&rsquo;s feather.</p>

<p>The servants said, &ldquo;Let us go to the well, to the boy who
has helped us before. We don&rsquo;t know where to get this
night-growing rice, but that boy is sure to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy was sitting by the well, and asked what they
wanted. They answered, &ldquo;See, the king has given us six
thousand rupees and a letter, and told us to fetch him some
night-growing rice.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son.
&ldquo;Come here in three weeks&rsquo; time, and I will give you some.&rdquo;
The servants gave him the rupees and returned home.</p>

<p>He took the rupees to his mothers, and told them he was
going on a fresh errand, and they were to keep the money.
Then he made them salaams, took his letter, and rode off.
The eaglet went too, and flew above his head. The tiger&rsquo;s
cub he left at home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
He rode on and on through a very large jungle, and he
rode a long, long way: at last in a jungle he saw a fak&iacute;r,
who was living in it. He made him salaams, and the fak&iacute;r
was delighted to see him, &ldquo;because,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for many years
I have been in this country, and all that time have never seen
any man.&rdquo; The prince sat down by the fak&iacute;r, and the fak&iacute;r
was very much pleased. He asked the boy who had sent
him to the jungle, and why he had come to it. &ldquo;My mother
has sore eyes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and wants some night-growing
rice. She has given me a letter to the man who owns it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fak&iacute;r took and read the letter, and was very sorry.
He tore it up and threw it away. Then he wrote another, in
which he said, &ldquo;Your sister is very ill, and her son has
come for some night-growing rice for her.&rdquo; This he gave
to the boy, and told him to continue his journey. He also
told him that the man who had the rice was a huge demon,
and that he lived in the country by the great sea. Then he
told him the way.</p>

<p>The boy rode on and on, and after a week&rsquo;s journeying he
came to the demon&rsquo;s country. There he saw the huge demon
sitting on the ground, with his great, big mouth, that was
just like a cavern. As soon as the demon saw him he stood
up and said, &ldquo;It is many days since a man came here. Now
I will eat this one.&rdquo; He went towards the prince to seize
him, and a great rushing wind came blowing from the
demon, as it always did when he was angry. But the boy,
who had begun to walk towards him when he stood up,
threw the letter to him with all his might, so that it fell
on him; at the same time he made many salaams. The
demon read the letter, and found his sister was very ill, and
this was her son; so he stopped the wind, and came up to
the boy, who he thought was his sister&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;You have
come for the rice for my sister who is ill,&rdquo; he said to him;
&ldquo;you shall have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
The demon had a splendid house full of beautiful things,
and a great many servants. He took the little prince home
with him, and told his servants to get water ready and gave
the child a bath. They were also to cook a good dinner
for him. Then the demon showed the boy all his gardens,
and all his beautiful things, and took him through all the
rooms of his house. One room he did not show to the
prince. He told him he was never to go into it, though he
might go everywhere else that he liked. In this room lived
the demon&rsquo;s daughter, who was very beautiful, just like a
fairy. She was ten years old. Every day before her father
went out, he used to make the girl lie on her bed, and cover
her with a sheet, and he placed a thick stick at her head, and
another at her feet; then she died till he came home in the
evening and changed the sticks, putting the one at her head
at her feet, and the one at her feet at her head. This brought
her to life again.</p>

<p>The next day, when the demon had gone out, the boy
went to this room, and opened the door, for he wanted to
see what was in it. He went in, and saw the beautiful girl
lying on the bed. &ldquo;How lovely she is!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but she
is dead.&rdquo; Then he saw the sticks, and, to amuse himself,
he put the one at her head at her feet, and the one at her
feet at her head, just as the demon did every evening. The
girl at once came to life, and opened her eyes and got up.
&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; she said to herself, when she saw the king&rsquo;s
son. &ldquo;This is not my father.&rdquo; She asked him, &ldquo;Who
are you? Why do you come here? If my father sees you
he will eat you.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;for I
am your aunt&rsquo;s son, and your father himself brought me to
his house. But why is it that you are dead all day, and
alive all night?&rdquo; The girl had told him that her father
brought her to life every evening, and made her dead every
morning. &ldquo;Such is my father&rsquo;s pleasure,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
So they talked together all day, and he said to her, &ldquo;Suppose
one day your father made you dead as usual, and that
he was killed before he had brought you to life, what would
you do? You would always be dead then.&rdquo; &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;no one can kill my father.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said the
boy. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;on the other side of the
sea there is a great tree, in that tree is a nest, in the nest
is a <i>main&aacute;</i>. If any one kills that <i>main&aacute;</i>, then only will my
father die. And if, when the <i>main&aacute;</i> is killed, its blood falls
to the ground, a hundred demons would be born from the
blood. This is why my father cannot be killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At evening, before the demon came home, the prince
made the girl dead. Then he went softly into another room.</p>

<p>The fak&iacute;r had said to the boy, when they were in the
jungle together, &ldquo;If ever you are in trouble, come to me
and I will help you. It will take you now one week to ride
to the demon&rsquo;s country; but if ever you need me, you shall
be able to come to me here in this jungle, and to return to
the demon&rsquo;s house in one day.&rdquo; The fak&iacute;r was such a holy
man that everything he said should happen did happen. So
now the prince determined he would go to the fak&iacute;r and
ask him what he should do to kill this <i>main&aacute;</i>. In the morning,
therefore, as soon as the demon had gone out, he set
off for the fak&iacute;r&rsquo;s jungle, and, thanks to the holy man&rsquo;s
power, he got there very quickly. He told him everything,
and the fak&iacute;r made a paper boat which he gave him. &ldquo;This
boat will take you over the sea,&rdquo; he said to the prince. &ldquo;This
paper boat!&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;How can a paper boat go over
the sea? It will get soaked and sink.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, it will not,&rdquo;
said the fak&iacute;r. &ldquo;Launch it on the sea, and get into it. The
boat will of itself carry you to the tree where the <i>main&aacute;&rsquo;s</i>
nest is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince took the boat, and went back to the demon&rsquo;s
house. He got there before the demon came home, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
he did not know the boy had been to the fak&iacute;r. When the
demon returned that evening, the king&rsquo;s son said, &ldquo;To-morrow
I will go home, as my mother is very ill. Will
you give me the rice?&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the demon, &ldquo;you
shall have it to-morrow.&rdquo; Next morning he gave the rice,
and went off to the jungle.</p>

<p>Then the boy took his paper boat down to the sea,
launched it, and got into it; and of itself the boat went
straight over the sea to the opposite shore. The eaglet flew
above his head; but he left his horse on land. When he
got to the other side, he saw the great tree, with the nest
and the <i>main&aacute;</i>. He climbed the tree, and took down the
nest, and the demon, who was far away, knew it at once,
and said to himself, &ldquo;Some one has come to catch and kill
me.&rdquo; He set out at once for the tree. The prince saw him
coming, so he wrapped the <i>main&aacute;</i> up in his handkerchief,
that no blood should fall to the ground. Then he broke off
one of its legs, and one of the demon&rsquo;s legs fell off. Still the
demon came on. Then he broke off the other leg, but the
demon walked on his hands. The boy saw him coming
nearer and nearer, so he wrung the bird&rsquo;s head off, and the
demon fell dead.</p>

<p>The prince jumped into his paper boat, and of itself the
boat went straight back to the other shore, to the demon&rsquo;s
country. Then he went up to the demon&rsquo;s house, and made
his daughter alive.</p>

<p>She was frightened, and said to him, &ldquo;Oh, take care. If
my father comes back, and finds us together, he will eat us
both.&rdquo; &ldquo;He will not come back,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;I
have killed him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he dressed her in boy&rsquo;s clothes, that no one might
know she was a girl, and he found a horse, and had it made
ready for her. Her father had collected a quantity of
rupees. Some of these the prince gave to the servants as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
present, and said to them, &ldquo;Stay here and be happy; do
not be afraid, for there is no demon now to come and eat
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he took the rice and mounted his horse, and made
the girl mount also, and went off to the fak&iacute;r. The paper
boat he left, as he did not want it any more. He and the
demon&rsquo;s daughter made the fak&iacute;r many salaams, and they
stayed with him for a day before they rode to the prince&rsquo;s
country. Here they went to his seven mothers, who were
very, very glad to see them, and thanked God that their son
had come back safe.</p>

<p>He took a little of the rice, and went and sat by the well
till the king&rsquo;s two servants came. Then he gave them the
rice for their king, and the king gave it to the demon. She
said nothing while the king was with her; but when she was
alone she cried, for she knew the boy must have killed her
brother, as he had brought her the rice.</p>

<p>She waited a week, and then she began to cry again, and
would not eat. The king was very sorry, and thought,
&ldquo;What can I do to make her well and happy?&rdquo; Then he
said, &ldquo;What will cure your eyes?&rdquo; &ldquo;See, king,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;if I could only bathe my eyes with water from the
Glittering Well, they would not pain me any more.&rdquo; This
well was in the fairies&rsquo; country, and was guarded by the
demon&rsquo;s sister, whose name was Jangkatar. She lived in
the well; and when any one came to draw water from it,
she used to drag him down and eat him.</p>

<p>The king called his servants, gave them eight thousand
rupees, and said, &ldquo;Go and fetch me water from the Glittering
Well.&rdquo; The servants went at once to the dry well in the
jungle. There they found the prince, who asked them what
they wanted. &ldquo;Here are eight thousand rupees,&rdquo; they said;
&ldquo;and the king has ordered us to bring him water from the
Glittering Well.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come in three weeks, and I will give it to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
you,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son. He took to his mothers the eight
thousand rupees which the servants had given him, and said
to them, &ldquo;Take care of these rupees, for I am going away
for a little while.&rdquo; Then he got his horse ready and mounted
it, and made many salaams to his mothers. The tiger-cub
said to him, &ldquo;Take me with you this time. Last time you
only took the eagle. Now we will both go with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he rode off; and the eaglet flew above his head and
the young tiger ran by his side. It took him a week to get
to the fairies&rsquo; country, and then he came to a beautiful
smooth plain, in which was a garden, but no house. In
the middle of this garden was the Glittering Well. It was
a deep well, and the water sprang up out of it like a fountain,
and then fell back into the well, and the water shone and
sparkled as if it were gold, and silver, and diamonds. This
is why it was called the Glittering Well.</p>

<p>The prince dipped his jar in the well, and Jangkatar put
up her hand and caught him. She dragged him into the
water and swallowed him whole. Then the young eagle
flew down into the well, seized Jangkatar in his talons, and
took her out and threw her on the ground. The tiger-cub
rushed at her instantly, tore her open, and pulled the king&rsquo;s
son out of her. But he was half dead. The cub and the
eaglet lay down on him to warm him, and when they had
warmed him, he was better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have saved you,&rdquo; they said to him. &ldquo;But for us
you would have died.&rdquo; The young prince thanked them
and caressed them. &ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;without
you I should have died.&rdquo; Then he filled his jar with water,
and mounted his horse and rode home. He made salaams
to his seven mothers, with whom all this time the demon&rsquo;s
daughter had stayed. He bathed his mothers&rsquo; eyes with the
water from the Glittering Well, and then they saw perfectly
once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
He took a little of the water, and went to wait for the
king&rsquo;s servants by the dry jungle well, and he was very
happy thinking that now his mothers could see. He gave
the water to the king&rsquo;s servants, who took it to the king, and
the king gave it to his demon-wife, and she was very sad and
angry, for she knew the boy must have killed her sister, the
guardian of the Glittering Well.</p>

<p>When a whole month had passed, and he had not been
sent on any more errands, the king&rsquo;s son said to himself,
&ldquo;Good; now nothing more is going to happen to me. I am
not to be sent anywhere else.&rdquo; So he bought a fine horse
and grand clothes, and rode to the king&rsquo;s court-house. He
went in, and seated himself at the king&rsquo;s right hand; but he
made no salaam to the king, and spoke to no one. This
he did every day for three days. Everybody was wondering
who this boy was, and why he never made any salaam to
the king.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, as he sat at the king&rsquo;s right hand, the
king asked him, &ldquo;Whose child are you? Where do you
come from? Where are you going?&rdquo; The young prince
answered, &ldquo;See, king, I am a merchant&rsquo;s son; my ship has
been wrecked, and I want to find service with some one.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any
trade,&rdquo; said his son; &ldquo;but I can tell you a story.&rdquo; &ldquo;What
wages do you want?&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;One thousand rupees
a day,&rdquo; answered the boy. &ldquo;I shall only stay a short time
in your country.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;I will give you
one thousand rupees a day, and a servant to wait on you
besides. So come every day to my court-house, and tell
me your story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince told the king his own story. He began from
where the king found the beautiful demon-girl crying in the
jungle, and ended it where his demon-wife cried and cried
for her sister Jangkatar. It took him three weeks to tell the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
story; and when he had finished it, the king knew that he
himself was the king in the story, and that this boy was his
own son. &ldquo;How can I find my seven queens again?&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;If you will kill this wicked demon-woman they will
come back to you,&rdquo; said his son. The king was very sad,
and thought, &ldquo;My seven wives and my boy must have suffered
very much.&rdquo; Then he loved his son, and was very
happy that he had found him. He ordered his servants to
dig a deep pit in the jungle, so deep that should his demon-wife
take her demon form when put into it, only her head
would be above it. He thought that if her body were buried
in the ground she would not be able to do them much harm
while they were shooting her. Then he, and his son, and
his servants took their guns and bows and arrows, and took
the demon with them to the deep pit. She went quite
quietly, though she knew they were going to kill her. Since
Jangkatar&rsquo;s death she had been very quiet and sad. And
now she thought, &ldquo;That boy will most certainly kill me as he
has killed my sister and brother. He is stronger than I
am. I have no one else to send him to; and if I had, he
could not be killed. What is the use of my trying to save
myself?&rdquo; So she went along quite quietly, looking like a
beautiful girl. She let them put her into the pit, and shoot
her to death with their guns and bows and arrows. Then
they filled the pit up with earth.</p>

<p>The king went to his seven wives, and begged them to
forgive him. He brought them, his son, and the demon&rsquo;s
daughter home to his palace. Later the king married his
son to the demon&rsquo;s daughter, and every one was glad.</p>

<p>But the king grieved that his six other sons were dead.</p>

THE FAN PRINCE.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxxv">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapi"><span class="dcap">I</span></span>N a country there lived a king who had a wife and
seven daughters. One day he called all his
daughters to him, and said to them, &ldquo;My children,
who gives you food? and by whose permission do you eat
it?&rdquo; Six of them answered, &ldquo;Father, you give us food;
and by your permission we eat it.&rdquo; But the seventh and
youngest said, &ldquo;Father, God gives me my food; and by
my own permission I eat it.&rdquo; This answer made her father
and mother very angry with their youngest daughter.
They said, &ldquo;We will not let our youngest child stay with us
any longer.&rdquo; And her father called some servants and said
to them, &ldquo;Get a palanquin ready, and put my youngest
daughter into it; then carry her away to the jungle, and there
leave her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servants got the palanquin ready, put the youngest
princess into it, and carried her into the jungle. There
they put the palanquin down and said to her, &ldquo;We are
going to drink some water.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go home now,&rdquo; said the girl,
&ldquo;as my father ordered you to do.&rdquo; They left her, therefore,
in the jungle alone, and went back to the king&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>The girl prayed to God and worshipped him; then she
went to sleep for a little while in her palanquin. When she
awoke, it was evening, and she found in her palanquin a
jar of water and some food on a plate which God had sent
her while she slept. She knew that God had sent her this
nice dinner, and thanked him and worshipped him. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
she bathed her face and hands in a little of the water, and
ate and drank, and went to sleep quietly in her palanquin as
night had come.</p>

<p>This little princess had always been a very gentle girl, and
had always done what was right, and been very good, so
God loved her dearly. While she slept, therefore, he made
a beautiful palace for her on the jungle-plain where she
was lying in her palanquin. God made a garden and tank
for her, too. When the princess woke in the morning, and
got out of her palanquin, she saw the palace standing by
its tank in a beautiful garden. &ldquo;I never saw that palace
before,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was not here last night.&rdquo; She went
into the garden, and servants met her and made her salaams.
The palace was far finer than her father&rsquo;s; and when she
went into it she found it full of servants. &ldquo;To whom does
this palace belong?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;To you,&rdquo; they answered.
&ldquo;God made all this for you last night, and he sent us to
wait on you and be your servants.&rdquo; (Now, they were all
men, not angels, that God had sent to take care of her.)
The princess thanked God, and worshipped him.</p>

<p>A few days later, her father heard that in the jungle to
which he had sent her a beautiful palace and garden and
tank had suddenly appeared, and that in this palace she
was living; and he said, &ldquo;Yes; my daughter told me the
truth: it is God who gives us everything. I know it is he
who gave her this beautiful house.&rdquo; So some time passed,
and the princess lived in her palace in the jungle; but her
father did not go to see her.</p>

<p>One day he said to himself, &ldquo;To-day I will go and eat
the air in another country, and I will go by water.&rdquo; So he
ordered a boat to be got ready, and he went to his six
daughters, and told them he was going away for a little
while. &ldquo;What would you like me to bring you from this
other country?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will bring you anything you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
would like to have.&rdquo; Some of them wanted jewels, a
necklace, a pair of earrings, and so on; and some wanted
silk stuffs for s&aacute;r&iacute;s and other clothes. Then the king
remembered his youngest child, and thought, &ldquo;I must send
to her, and see what she would like.&rdquo; He called one of
his servants, and told him to go to the jungle to his youngest
daughter and say, &ldquo;Your father is going to eat the air of
another country. He wishes to know what you would like
him to bring back for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant found the little princess reading her prayer-book.
He gave her the king&rsquo;s message. She said, &ldquo;Sabr&rdquo;
(that is <i>wait</i>), for she meant him to wait for her answer till
she had finished reading her prayers. The servant, however,
did not understand, but went away at once to the king and
told him, &ldquo;Your daughter wants you to bring her Sabr.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sabr?&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;what is Sabr? Never, mind, I
will see if I can find any Sabr; and if I do, I will bring it
for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king then went in his boat to another country.
There he stayed for a little while and bought the jewels
and silks for his six elder daughters. When he thought he
should like to go home again, he went down to his boat
and got into it. But the boat would not move, because he
had forgotten one thing; the thing his youngest daughter
had asked for.</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered he had not got any Sabr. So
he gave one of his servants four thousand rupees, and told
him to go on shore, and go through the bazar, and try and
find the Sabr, and he was to give the four thousand rupees
for it.</p>

<p>The man went to the bazar and asked every one if they
had Sabr to sell. Then he asked if they could tell him
what it was. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;but our king&rsquo;s son is called
Sabr; you had better speak to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
The servant went to Prince Sabr. &ldquo;Our king&rsquo;s youngest
daughter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has asked her father to bring her
Sabr, and the king has given me four thousand rupees to
buy it for her; but I cannot get any, and no one knows
what it is.&rdquo; The prince said, &ldquo;Very good. Give this little
box to your king, and tell him to give it to his youngest
daughter. But it is only the princess who has asked for
Sabr who is to open the box.&rdquo; Then he told the man to
keep the four thousand rupees as a present from him.</p>

<p>The servant went back to the boat to the king and gave
him the box, saying, &ldquo;In this is the Sabr,&rdquo; and he told him
Prince Sabr said no one but the youngest princess was to
open it. And now the boat moved quite easily, and the
king journeyed home safely.</p>

<p>He gave his six eldest daughters the presents he had
brought for them, and sent the little box to his youngest
daughter. She said, &ldquo;My father has sent me this. I will
look at it by and by.&rdquo; Then she put it away and forgot it.
At the end of a month she found the little box, and thought,
&ldquo;I will see what my father has sent me,&rdquo; and opened the
box. In it was a most lovely little fan. She was very
much pleased, and fanned herself with it, and at once a
beautiful prince stood before her.</p>

<p>The princess was delighted. &ldquo;Who are you? Where
did you come from?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My name is Prince
Sabr,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Your father came to my father&rsquo;s
country, and he said you had asked him to bring you Sabr,
so I gave him this little fan for you. I am obliged to come
to whoever uses this little fan with the right side turned outwards.
And when you want me to go away, you must turn
the right side of the fan towards you and then fan yourself
with it.&rdquo; The little princess said, &ldquo;Very good. And so
your name is Prince Sabr?&rdquo; They talked together for
some time. Then she turned her fan, so that the wrong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
side was outside, and fanned herself with it, and the prince
disappeared.</p>

<p>This went on for a month. The princess used to fan herself
with the right side turned outwards, and then Prince
Sabr came to her. When she turned her fan wrong side
outwards and fanned herself, then he vanished.</p>

<p>One day the prince said to her, &ldquo;I should like to marry
you. Will you marry me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered. Then
she wrote a letter to her father and mother and six sisters,
in which she said, &ldquo;Come to my wedding. I am going to
marry Prince Sabr.&rdquo; They all came. Her father was very
glad that she married Prince Sabr, and said, &ldquo;I see it is true
that God loves my youngest daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The day of the wedding her six sisters said to her, &ldquo;To-day
we will not let the servants make your bed. We will
make it ourselves for you.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have plenty of servants to
make it,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but you can do so if you like.&rdquo; Her
sisters went to make the bed. They took a glass bottle and
ground it into a powder, and they spread the powder all over
the side where Prince Sabr was to lie. This they did because
they were angry at their youngest sister being married,
while they, who were older, were not married, and they
thought, being her elders, they should have married first,
especially as they had lived in their father&rsquo;s palace, and been
cared for, while she was cast out in the jungle.</p>

<p>When the wedding was over, and Prince Sabr and his
wife had gone to bed, the prince became very ill, from the
glass powder going into his flesh. &ldquo;Turn your fan the
wrong way and fan yourself quickly, that I may go home
to my father&rsquo;s country,&rdquo; he said to her, &ldquo;for I am very ill,
and dare not remain here.&rdquo; So she fanned herself at once
with the fan turned the wrong way. Then he went home
to his father, and was very ill for a long while. The poor
princess knew nothing of the glass powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
Her father and mother and sisters went home after the
wedding, and left the princess alone in her palace. Every
day she turned her fan the right side outwards and fanned
and fanned herself; but Prince Sabr never came. He was
far too ill. One day she cried a great deal, and was very,
very sad. &ldquo;Why does my prince not come to me?&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where he is, or what has become of
him.&rdquo; That night she had a dream, and in her dream she
saw Prince Sabr lying very ill on his bed.</p>

<p>When she got up in the morning she thought she must go
and try to find her prince. So she took off all her beautiful
clothes and jewels, and put on a yog&iacute;&rsquo;s dress. Then she
mounted a horse and set out in the jungle. No one knew
she was a woman, or that she was a king&rsquo;s daughter; every
one thought she was a man.</p>

<p>She rode on till night, and then she had come to another
jungle. Here she got off her horse, and took it under a tree.
She lay down under the tree and went to sleep. At midnight
she was awakened by the chattering of a parrot and a <i>main&aacute;</i>, who
came and sat on the tree knowing she was lying underneath.</p>

<p>The <i>main&aacute;</i> said to the parrot, &ldquo;Parrot, tell me something.&rdquo;
The parrot said, &ldquo;Prince Sabr is very, very ill in his own
country. The day he was married, the bride&rsquo;s six sisters
took a glass bottle and ground it to powder. Then they
spread the powder all over the prince&rsquo;s bed, so that when
he lay down it got into his flesh. The glass powder has made
him very ill.&rdquo; &ldquo;What will make him well?&rdquo; said the <i>main&aacute;</i>;
&ldquo;what will cure him?&rdquo; &ldquo;No doctors can cure him,&rdquo; said the
parrot; &ldquo;no medicine will do him any good: but if any one
slept under this tree, and took some of the earth from under
it, and mixed it with cold water, and rubbed it all over Prince
Sabr, he would get well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this the princess heard. She got up and longed for
morning to come. When it was day she took some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
earth, mounted her horse, and rode off. She went on till she
came to Prince Sabr&rsquo;s country. Then she asked to whom
the country belonged; she was told it was Prince Sabr&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s country, &ldquo;but Prince Sabr is very ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a yog&iacute;,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;and I can cure him.&rdquo;
This was told to the king, Prince Sabr&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;That
is very good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Send the yog&iacute; to me.&rdquo; So the
little princess went to the king, who said to her, &ldquo;My son
is very, very ill; make him well.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will
make him well. Bring me some cold water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They brought her the cold water, and she mixed it with
the earth she had got from under the tree. This she rubbed
all over the prince. For three days and nights she rubbed
him with it. After that he got better, and in a week he
was quite well. He was able to talk, and could walk about
as usual.</p>

<p>Then the yog&iacute; said, &ldquo;Now I will go back to my own
country.&rdquo; But the king said to her, &ldquo;First you must let me
give you a present. You shall have anything that you like.
As many horses, or sepoys, or rupees as you want you shall
have; for you have made my son well.&rdquo; &ldquo;I want nothing
at all,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;but Prince Sabr&rsquo;s ring, and the
handkerchief he has with his name worked on it.&rdquo; She
had given him both these things on their wedding day.
Prince Sabr&rsquo;s father and mother went to their son and begged
him to give the handkerchief and ring to the yog&iacute;; and he
did so quite willingly. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;were it not for
that yog&iacute;, I should never see my dear princess again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The yog&iacute; took the ring and handkerchief and went home.
When she got there, she took off her yog&iacute;&rsquo;s dress and put
on her own beautiful clothes. Then she turned her fan
right side outwards, and fanned herself with it, and immediately
her Prince Sabr stood by her. &ldquo;Why did you not
come to me before?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have been fanning and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
fanning myself.&rdquo; &ldquo;I was very ill, and could not come,&rdquo;
said Prince Sabr. &ldquo;At last a yog&iacute; came and made me well,
and as a reward I gave him my ring and handkerchief.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It was no yog&iacute;,&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;It was I who came
to you and made you well.&rdquo; &ldquo;You!&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;Oh,
no; it was a yog&iacute;. You were sitting here in your palace
while the yog&iacute; came and cured me.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;I was the yog&iacute;. See, is not this your ring? is not
this your handkerchief with your name worked on it?&rdquo;
Then he believed her, and she told him of her dream, and
her journey in the yog&iacute;&rsquo;s dress, and the birds&rsquo; talk, and all
that had happened.</p>

<p>And Prince Sabr was very happy that his wife had done
so much for him, and they lived happily together.</p>

THE BED.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxxvi">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapi"><span class="dcap">I</span></span>N a country there was a grain merchant&rsquo;s son, whose
father and mother loved him so dearly that they
did not let him do anything but play and amuse
himself while they worked for him. They never taught him
any trade, or anything at all; for they never reflected that
they might die, and that then he would have to work for
himself. When he was old enough to be married, they
found a wife for him, and married him to her. Then they
all lived happily together for some years till the father and
mother both died.</p>

<p>Their son and his wife lived for a while on the pice his
father and mother had left him. But the wife grew sadder
and sadder every day, for the pice grew fewer and fewer.
She thought, &ldquo;What shall we do when they are all gone?
My husband knows no trade, and can do no work.&rdquo; One
day when she was looking very sorrowful, her husband asked
her, &ldquo;What is the matter? Why are you so unhappy?&rdquo;
&ldquo;We have hardly any pice left,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and what
shall we do when we have eaten the few we have? You
know no trade, and can do no work.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said
her husband, &ldquo;I can do some work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So one day when there were hardly any pice left, he took
an axe, and said to his wife, &ldquo;I am going out to-day to
work. Give me my dinner to take with me, and I will eat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
it out of doors.&rdquo; She gave him some food, wondering what
work he had; but she did not ask him.</p>

<p>He went to a jungle, where he stayed all day, and where he
ate his dinner. All day long he wandered from tree to tree,
saying to each, &ldquo;May I cut you down?&rdquo; But not a tree
in the jungle gave him any answer: so he cut none down,
and went home in the evening. His wife did not ask where
he had been, or what he had done, and he said nothing to her.</p>

<p>The next day he again asked her for food to take with
him to eat out of doors, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am going to work
all day.&rdquo; She did not like to ask him any questions, but
gave him the food. And he took his axe, and went out to
a jungle which was on a different side to the one he had
been to yesterday. In this jungle also he went to every tree,
and said to it, &ldquo;May I cut you down?&rdquo; No tree answered
him; so he ate his dinner and came home.</p>

<p>The next day he went to a third jungle on the third side.
There, too, he asked each tree, &ldquo;May I cut you down?&rdquo;
But none gave him any answer. He came home therefore
very sorrowful.</p>

<p>On the fourth day he went to a jungle on the fourth side.
All day long he went from tree to tree, asking each, &ldquo;May
I cut you down?&rdquo; None answered. At last, towards evening,
he went and stood under a mango-tree. &ldquo;May I cut
you down?&rdquo; he said to it. &ldquo;Yes, cut me down,&rdquo; answered
the tree. God loved the merchant&rsquo;s son and wished him to
grow a great man, so he ordered the mango-tree to let itself
be cut down.</p>

<p>Now the grain merchant&rsquo;s son was happy, for he was quite
sure he could make a bed, if he only had some wood; so he
hewed down the mango-tree, put it on his head, and carried
it home. His wife saw him coming, and said to herself,
&ldquo;He is bringing home a tree! What can he be going to
do with a tree?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
Next morning he took the tree into one of the rooms of
his house. He told his wife to put food and water to last him
for a week in this room, and to make a fire in it. Then he
went up to the room, and said to her, &ldquo;You are not to come
in here for a whole week. You are not to come near me till
I call you.&rdquo; Then he went into the room and shut the door.
The whole week long his wife wondered what he could be
doing all alone in that room. &ldquo;I cannot see into it,&rdquo; she said
to herself, &ldquo;and I dare not open the door. I wonder what
he is about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the end of the week the grain merchant&rsquo;s son had carved
a most beautiful bed out of the mango-tree. Such a beautiful
bed had never been seen. Then he called his wife, and
when she came he told her to open the door, and when she
opened it he said, &ldquo;See what a beautiful bed I have made.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Did <em>you</em> make that bed?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh, what a beautiful
bed it is! I never saw such a lovely bed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rested that day, and on the day following he took the
bed to the king&rsquo;s palace, and sat down with it before the
palace gate. The king&rsquo;s servants all came to look at the bed.
&ldquo;What a bed it is!&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Did any one ever see such
a bed! It is a beautiful bed. Is it yours?&rdquo; they asked the
merchant&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Is it for sale? Who made it? Did you
make it?&rdquo; But he said, &ldquo;I will not answer any of your
questions. I will not speak to any of you. I will only
speak to the king.&rdquo; So the servants went to the king and
said to him, &ldquo;There is a man at your gate with a most
beautiful bed. But he will not speak to any of us, and says
he will only speak to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the king;
&ldquo;bring him to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the grain merchant&rsquo;s son came before the king with
his bed, the king asked him, &ldquo;Is your bed for sale?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;What a beautiful bed it is!&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Who
made it?&rdquo; &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I made it myself.&rdquo; &ldquo;How
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
much do you want for it?&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;One thousand
rupees,&rdquo; answered the merchant&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;That is a great
deal for the bed,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;I will not take less,&rdquo; said
the merchant&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;I will give you
the thousand rupees.&rdquo; So he took the bed, and the merchant&rsquo;s
son said to him, &ldquo;The first night you pass on it, do not go to
sleep. Take care to keep awake, and you will hear and see
something.&rdquo; Then he took the rupees home to his wife,
who was frightened when she saw them. &ldquo;Are those your
rupees?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Where did you find such a quantity
of rupees?&rdquo; &ldquo;The king gave them to me for my bed,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I am not a thief; I did not steal them.&rdquo; Then she
was happy.</p>

<p>That night the king lay down on his bed, and at ten
o&rsquo;clock he heard one of the bed&rsquo;s legs say to the other legs,
&ldquo;Listen, you three. I am going out to see the king&rsquo;s country.
Do you all stand firm while I am away, and take care not to
let the king fall.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; the three legs answered; &ldquo;go
and eat the air, and we will all stand fast, so that the king
does not fall while you are away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the king saw the leg leave the bed, and go out of
his room door. The leg went out to a great plain, and there
it saw two snakes quarrelling together. One snake said,
&ldquo;I will bite the king.&rdquo; The other said, &ldquo;I will bite him.&rdquo;
The first said, &ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t; I will climb on to his bed
and bite him.&rdquo; &ldquo;That you will never do,&rdquo; said the second.
&ldquo;You cannot climb on to his bed; but I will get into his
shoe, and then when he puts it on to-morrow morning, I
will bite his foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bed-leg came back and told the other legs what it
had seen and heard. &ldquo;If the king will shake his shoe
before he puts it on to-morrow morning,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;he will
see a snake drop out of it.&rdquo; The king heard all that was
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the second bed-leg, &ldquo;I will go out and eat
the air of the king&rsquo;s country. Do you all stand firm while
I am away.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; the others answered; &ldquo;we will take
care the king does not fall.&rdquo; The second bed-leg then went
out, and went to another plain on which stood a very old
palace belonging to the king, and the wind told it the palace
was so ruinous that it would fall and kill the king the first
time he went into it: the king had never once had it repaired.
So it came back and told the three other legs all about the
palace and what the wind had said. &ldquo;If I were the king,&rdquo;
said the second bed-leg, &ldquo;I would have that palace pulled
down. It is quite ready to fall; and the first time the king
goes into it, it will fall on him and kill him.&rdquo; The king
lay, and listened to everything. As it happened, he had
forgotten all about his old palace, and had not gone near it
for a long time.</p>

<p>Then the third bed-leg said, &ldquo;Now I will go out and
see all the fun I can. Stand firm, you three, while I am
away.&rdquo; He went to a jungle-plain on which lived a yog&iacute;.
Now there was a sarai<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> not far off in which lived a woman,
the wife of a sepoy, whose husband had gone a year ago to
another country, leaving her in the sarai. She was so fond
of the yog&iacute;, that she used to come and talk to him every
night. That very day her husband came back to her, and
therefore it was later than usual when she got to the yog&iacute;;
so he was very vexed with her. &ldquo;How late you are to-night,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;It is not my fault,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;My husband
came home to-day after having been away a year, and he
kept me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Which of us do you love best?&rdquo; asked the
yog&iacute;; &ldquo;your husband or me?&rdquo; &ldquo;I love you best,&rdquo; said
the woman. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the yog&iacute;, &ldquo;go home and cut
off your husband&rsquo;s head, and bring it here for me to see.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
The sepoy&rsquo;s wife went straight to the sarai, cut off her
husband&rsquo;s head, and brought it to the yog&iacute;. &ldquo;What a
wicked woman you are to do such a thing at my bidding!&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Go away at once. You are a wicked woman,
and I do not want to see you.&rdquo; She took the head home,
set it again on the body and began to cry. All the people
in the sarai came to see what was the matter. &ldquo;Thieves
have been here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and have killed my husband,
and cut off his head,&rdquo; and then she cried again. The third
bed-leg now went back to the palace, and told the others all
it had seen and heard. The king lay still and listened.</p>

<p>The fourth bed-leg next went out to see all it could, and
it came to a plain on which were seven thieves, who had
just been into the king&rsquo;s palace, and had carried off his
daughter on her bed fast asleep; and there she lay still
sleeping. They had, too, been into the king&rsquo;s treasury and
had taken all his rupees. The fourth bed-leg came quickly
back to the palace, and said to the other three legs, &ldquo;Now,
if the king were wise he would get up instantly and go to
the plain. For some thieves are there with his daughter
and all his rupees which they have just stolen out of his
palace. If he only made haste and went at once, he would
get them again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king got up that minute, and called his servants and
some sepoys, and set off to the plain. He shook his shoe
before he put it on, and out tumbled the snake (the other
had quietly gone into the jungle, and not come to the palace);
so he saw that the first bed-leg had spoken the truth.</p>

<p>When he reached the plain he found his daughter and his
rupees, and brought them back to his palace. The princess
slept all the time, and did not know what had happened to
her. The king saw the fourth leg had told the truth. The
thieves he could not catch, for they all ran away when they
saw him coming with his sepoys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
The king sent men to the old palace to pull it down.
They found it was just going to fall, and would have fallen
on any one who had entered it, and crushed him. So the
second bed-leg had told the truth.</p>

<p>When the king was sitting in his court-house he heard
how during the night thieves had gone into the sarai and
killed a sepoy there and cut off his head. Then he sent for
the sepoy&rsquo;s wife, and asked her who had killed her husband.
&ldquo;Thieves,&rdquo; she said. The king was very angry, for he was
sure the third bed-leg had told the truth as the other three
legs had done. So he ordered the man to be buried; and
bade his servants make a great wooden pile on the plain,
and take the woman and burn her on it. They were not to
leave her as long as she was alive, but to wait till she was
dead.</p>

<p>He next sent for the grain merchant&rsquo;s son, and said to
him, &ldquo;Had it not been for your bed, I should this morning
have been bitten by a snake; and, perhaps, killed by my
old palace falling on me, as I did not know it was ready to
fall, and so might have gone into it. My daughter would
certainly have been stolen from me; and a wicked woman
been still alive. So now, to-morrow, bring as many carts as
you like, and I will give you as a present as many rupees
as you can take away on them in half a day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early the next morning the merchant&rsquo;s son brought his
cart and took away on them as many rupees as he could in
half a day. His wife was delighted when she saw the money,
and said, &ldquo;My husband only worked for one week, and
yet he earned all these rupees!&rdquo; And they lived always
happily.</p>

P&Aacute;NWPATT&Iacute; R&Aacute;N&Iacute;.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxxvii">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapi"><span class="dcap">I</span></span>N a country a big fair was held, to which came a great
many people and R&aacute;j&aacute;s from all the countries
round. Among them was a R&aacute;j&aacute; who brought his
daughter with him. Opposite their tent another tent was
pitched, in which lived a R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son. He was very beautiful;
so was the little R&aacute;n&iacute;, the other R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>Now, the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son and the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s daughter did not even
know each other&rsquo;s names, but they looked at each other a
great deal, and each thought the other very beautiful.
&ldquo;How lovely the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s daughter is!&rdquo; thought the prince.
&ldquo;How beautiful the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son is!&rdquo; thought the princess.</p>

<p>They lived opposite each other for a whole month, and all
that time they never spoke to each other nor did they speak
of each other to any one. But they thought of each other
a great deal.</p>

<p>When the month was over, the little R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s father said he
would go back to his own country. The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son sat in
his tent and watched the servants getting ready the little
R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s palanquin. As soon as the princess herself was
dressed and ready for the journey, she came out of her tent,
and took a rose in her hand. She first put the rose to her
teeth; then she stuck it behind her ear; and lastly, she laid
it at her feet. All this time the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son sat in his tent
and looked at her. Then she got into her palanquin and
was carried away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son was now very sad. &ldquo;How lovely the
princess is!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;And I do not know her name,
or her father&rsquo;s name, or the name of her country. So how
can I ever find her? I shall never see her again.&rdquo; He
was very sorrowful, and determined he would go home to
his country. When he got home he laid himself down on
his bed, and night and day he lay there. He would not eat,
or drink, or bathe, or change his clothes. This made his
father and mother very unhappy. They went to him often,
and asked him, &ldquo;What is the matter with you? Are you
ill?&rdquo; &ldquo;I want nothing,&rdquo; he would answer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
any doctor, or any medicine.&rdquo; Not one word did he say to
them, or to any one else, about the lovely little R&aacute;n&iacute;.</p>

<p>The son of the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s kotw&aacute;l<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was the prince&rsquo;s great
friend. The two had always gone to school together, and
had there read in the same book; they had always bathed,
eaten, and played together. So when the prince had been
at home for two days, and yet had not been to school or
seen his friend, the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son grew very anxious. &ldquo;Why
does the prince not come to school?&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;He has been here for two days, and yet I have not seen
him. I will go and find out if anything is the matter.
Perhaps he is ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went, therefore, to see the prince, who was lying very
miserable on his bed. &ldquo;Why do you not come to school?
Are you ill?&rdquo; asked his friend. &ldquo;Oh, it is nothing,&rdquo; said the
prince. &ldquo;Tell me what is the matter,&rdquo; said the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son;
but the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son would not answer. &ldquo;Have you told any
one what is the matter with you?&rdquo; said the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the prince. &ldquo;Then tell me,&rdquo; said his
friend; &ldquo;tell me the truth: what is it that troubles you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;at the fair there was a R&aacute;j&aacute; who
had a most beautiful daughter. They lived in a tent opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
mine, and I used to see her every day. She is so beautiful!
But I do not know her name, or her father&rsquo;s name, or her
country&rsquo;s name; so how can I ever find her?&rdquo; &ldquo;I will take
you to her,&rdquo; said his friend; &ldquo;only get up and bathe, and
eat.&rdquo; &ldquo;How can you take me to her?&rdquo; said the prince.
&ldquo;You do not even know where she is; so how can you
take me to her?&rdquo; &ldquo;Did she never speak to you?&rdquo; said the
kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;But when she
was going away, just before she got into her palanquin,
she took a rose in her hand; and first she put this rose to
her teeth; then she stuck it behind her ear; and then she
laid it at her feet.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now I know all about her,&rdquo; said his
friend. &ldquo;When she put the rose to her teeth, she meant to
tell you her father&rsquo;s name was R&aacute;j&aacute; D&aacute;nt [R&aacute;j&aacute; Tooth];
when she put it behind her ear she meant you to know her
country&rsquo;s name was Karn&aacute;tak [on the ear]; and when she
laid the rose at her feet, she meant that her name was
P&aacute;nwpatt&iacute; [Foot-leaf]. Get up; bathe and dress, eat and
drink, and we will go and find her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince got up directly, and told his father and mother
he was going for a few days to eat the air of another country.
At first they forbad his going; but then they reflected that
he had been very ill, and that perhaps the air of another
country might make him well; so at last they consented.
The prince and his friend had two horses saddled and
bridled, and set off together.</p>

<p>At the end of a month they arrived in a country where
they asked (as they had asked in every other country through
which they had ridden), &ldquo;What is the name of this country?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Karn&aacute;tak&rdquo; [the Carnatic]. &ldquo;What is your R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
&ldquo;R&aacute;j&aacute; D&aacute;nt.&rdquo; Then the two friends were glad. They
stopped at an old woman&rsquo;s house, and said to her, &ldquo;Let us
stay with you for a few days. We are men from another
country and do not know where to go in this place.&rdquo; The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
old woman said, &ldquo;You may stay with me if you like. I
live all alone, and there is plenty of room for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After two or three days the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son said to the old
woman, &ldquo;Has your R&aacute;j&aacute; a daughter?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered;
&ldquo;he has a daughter; her name is P&aacute;nwpatt&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can
you go to see her?&rdquo; asked the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;I can go to see her. I was her nurse, and she
drank my milk. It is the R&aacute;j&aacute; who gives me my house, and
my food, and clothes&mdash;everything that I have.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then go
and see her,&rdquo; said the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;and tell her that the
prince whom she called to her at the fair has come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman went up to the palace, and saw the
princess. After they had talked together for some time, she
said to the little R&aacute;n&iacute;, &ldquo;The prince you called to you at the
fair is come.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;tell him to come to see
me to-night at twelve o&rsquo;clock. He is not to come in through
the door, but through the window.&rdquo; (This she said because
she did not want her father to know that the prince had
come, until she had made up her mind whether she would
marry him.)</p>

<p>The old woman went home and told the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son
what the Princess P&aacute;nwpatt&iacute; said. That night the prince
went to see her, and every night for three or four nights
he went to talk with her for an hour. Then she told her
mother she wished to be married, and her mother told her
father. Her father asked whom she wished to marry, and she
said, &ldquo;The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son who lives in my nurse&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; Her
father said she might marry him if she liked; so the wedding
was held. The kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son went to the wedding, and
then returned to the old woman&rsquo;s house; but the prince
lived in the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>Here he stayed for a month, and all that time he never saw
his friend. At last he began to fret for him, and was very
unhappy. &ldquo;What makes you so sad?&rdquo; said P&aacute;nwpatt&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am sad because I have not seen my friend for a whole
month,&rdquo; answered her husband. &ldquo;I must go and see him.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, go and see him,&rdquo; said his wife. The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son went
to the old woman&rsquo;s house, and there he stayed a week, for he
was so glad to see the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son. Then he returned to
his wife. Now she thought he would only have been away
a day, and was very angry at his having stayed so long from
her. &ldquo;How could you leave me for a whole week?&rdquo; she said
to him. &ldquo;I had not seen my friend for a month,&rdquo; he
answered. P&aacute;nwpatt&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; did not let her husband see how
angry she was; but in her heart she thought, &ldquo;I am sure
he loves his friend best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince remained with her for a month. Then he
said, &ldquo;I must go and see my friend.&rdquo; This made her
very angry indeed. However, she said, &ldquo;Good; go and
see your friend, and I will make you some delicious sweetmeats
to take him from me.&rdquo; She set to work, and made
the most tempting sweetmeats she could; only in each she
put a strong poison. Then she wrapped them in a beautiful
handkerchief, and her husband took them to the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s
son. &ldquo;My R&aacute;n&iacute; has made you these herself,&rdquo; he said
to his friend, &ldquo;and she sends you a great many salaams.&rdquo;
The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son knew nothing of the poison.</p>

<p>The kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son put the sweetmeats on one side, and
said, &ldquo;Let us talk, and I will eat them by and by.&rdquo; So
they sat and talked for a long time. Then the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son
said, &ldquo;Your R&aacute;n&iacute; herself made these sweetmeats for me?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son. His friend was very wise, and
he thought, &ldquo;P&aacute;nwpatt&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; does not like me. Of that I
am sure.&rdquo; So he took some of the sweetmeats, and broke
them into bits and threw them to the crows. The crows
came flying down, and all the crows who ate the sweetmeats
died instantly. Then the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son threw a sweetmeat
to a dog that was passing. The dog devoured it and fell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
dead. This put the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son into great rage. &ldquo;I will
never see my R&aacute;n&iacute; again!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What a wicked
woman she is to try and poison my friend&mdash;my friend
whom I love so dearly; but for whom I should never have
married her!&rdquo; He would not go back to his wife, and stayed
in the old woman&rsquo;s house. The kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son often told
him he ought to return to his wife, but the prince would
not do so. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she is a wicked woman. You
never did her any evil or hurt; yet she has tried to poison
you. I will never see her again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When a month had passed, the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son said to the
prince, &ldquo;You really must go back to P&aacute;nwpatt&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;; she
is your wife, and you must go to her, and take her away to
your own country.&rdquo; Still the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son declared he would
never see her again. &ldquo;If you would like to see something
that will please you,&rdquo; said his friend, &ldquo;go back to your wife
for one day; and to-night &lsquo;when she is asleep&rsquo; you must take
off all her jewels, and tie them up in a handkerchief, and
bring them to me. But before you leave her you must wound
her in the leg with this trident.&rdquo; So saying, he gave him a
small iron trident.</p>

<p>The prince went back to the palace. His wife was very
angry with him, though she did not show her anger. At
night &lsquo;when she was fast asleep&rsquo; he took off all her jewels and
tied them in a handkerchief, and he gave her a thrust in the
leg with his trident. Then he went quickly back to his
friend. The princess awoke and found herself badly hurt
and alone; and she saw that her jewels were all gone. In
the morning she told her father and mother that her jewels
had been stolen; but she said nothing about the wound
in her leg. The king called his servants, and told them
a thief had come in the night and stolen his daughter&rsquo;s
jewels, and he sent them to look for the thief and seize
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
That morning the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son got up and dressed himself
like a yog&iacute;. He made the prince put on common
clothes such as every one wears, so that he could not be
recognized, and sent him to the bazar to sell his wife&rsquo;s
jewels. He told him, too, all he was to say. The pretended
yog&iacute; went to the river and sat down by it, and the
R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son went through the bazar and tried to sell the
jewels. The R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s servants seized him immediately. &ldquo;You
thief!&rdquo; they said to him, &ldquo;what made you steal our R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s
daughter&rsquo;s jewels?&rdquo; &ldquo;I know nothing about the jewels,&rdquo; said
the prince. &ldquo;I am no thief; I did not steal them. The
holy man, who is my teacher, gave them to me to sell in the
bazar for him. If you want to know anything more about
them, you must ask him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where is this holy man?&rdquo; said
the servants. &ldquo;He is sitting by the river,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s
son. &ldquo;Let us go to him. I will show you where he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all went down to the river, and there sat the yog&iacute;.
&ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; said the servants to him. &ldquo;Are you a
yog&iacute;, and yet a thief? Why did you steal the little R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s
jewels?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are those the little R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s jewels?&rdquo; said the
yog&iacute;. &ldquo;I did not steal them; I did not know to whom they
belonged. Listen, and I will tell you. Last night at twelve
o&rsquo;clock I was sitting by this river when a woman came down
to it&mdash;a woman I did not know. She took a dead body out
of the river, and began to eat it. This made me so angry,
that I took all her jewels from her, and she ran away. I ran
after her and wounded her in the leg with my trident. I
don&rsquo;t know if she were your R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s daughter, or who she was;
but whoever she may be, she has the mark of the trident&rsquo;s
teeth in her leg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servants took the jewels up to the palace, and told the
R&aacute;j&aacute; all the yog&iacute; had said. The R&aacute;j&aacute; asked his wife whether
the Princess P&aacute;nwpatt&iacute; had any hurt in her leg, and told her
all the yog&iacute;&rsquo;s story. The R&aacute;n&iacute; went to see her daughter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
and found her lying on her bed and unable to get up from
the pain she was in, and when she looked at her leg she saw
the wound. She returned to the R&aacute;j&aacute; and said to him, &ldquo;Our
daughter has the mark of the trident&rsquo;s teeth in her leg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The R&aacute;j&aacute; got very angry, and called his servants and said
to them, &ldquo;Bring a palanquin, and take my daughter at once
to the jungle, and there leave her. She is a wicked woman,
who goes to the river at night to eat dead people. I will
not have her in my house any more. Cast her out in the
jungle.&rdquo; The servants did as they were bid, and left
P&aacute;nwpatt&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;, crying and sobbing in the jungle, partly
from the pain in her leg, and partly because she did not
know where to go, and had no food or water.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her husband and the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son heard of
her being sent into the jungle, so they returned to the old
woman&rsquo;s house and put on their own clothes. Then they
went to the jungle to find her. She was still crying, and her
husband asked her why she cried. She told him, and he
said, &ldquo;Why did you try to poison my friend? You were
very wicked to do so.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son; &ldquo;Why
did you try to kill me? I have never done you any wrong
or hurt you. It was I who told your husband what you
meant by putting the rose to your teeth, behind your ear,
and at your feet. Without me he would never have found
you, never have married you.&rdquo; Then she knew at once who
had brought all this trouble to her, and she was very sorry she
had tried to kill her husband&rsquo;s friend.</p>

<p>They all three now went home to her husband&rsquo;s country;
and his father and mother were very glad indeed that their
son had married a R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s daughter, and the R&aacute;j&aacute; gave the
kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son a very grand present.</p>

<p>The young R&aacute;j&aacute; and his wife lived with his father and
mother, and were always very happy together.</p>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxxviii">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapi"><span class="dcap">I</span></span>N a country there was a merchant who traded in all
kinds of merchandise, and used to make journeys
from country to country in his boat to buy and sell
his goods. He one day said to his wife, &ldquo;I cannot stay at
home any more, for I must go on a year&rsquo;s journey to carry
on my business.&rdquo; And he added, laughing, &ldquo;When I return
I expect to find you have built me a grand well; and also,
as you are such a clever wife, to see a little son.&rdquo; Then he
got into his boat and went away.</p>

<p>When he was gone his wife set to work, and she spun
four hanks of beautiful thread with her own hands. Then
she dressed herself in her prettiest clothes, and put on her
finest jewels. &ldquo;I am going to the bazar,&rdquo; she said to her
ayahs, &ldquo;to sell this thread.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is not right,&rdquo; said one
of the ayahs. &ldquo;You must not sell your thread yourself, but
let me sell it for you. What will your husband say if he
hears you have been selling thread in the bazar?&rdquo; &ldquo;I will
sell my thread myself,&rdquo; answered the merchant&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;You
could never sell it for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So off she set to the bazar, and every one in it said,
&ldquo;What a beautiful woman that is!&rdquo; At last the kotw&aacute;l saw
her, and came to her at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What beautiful thread!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is it for sale?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How much a hank?&rdquo; said the kotw&aacute;l.
&ldquo;Fifty rupees,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Fifty rupees! Who will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
ever give you fifty rupees for it?&rdquo; &ldquo;I will not sell it for
less,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;I shall get fifty rupees for it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the kotw&aacute;l, &ldquo;I will give you the fifty rupees.
Can I dine with you at your house?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;to-night at ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; Then he took the thread and
gave her fifty rupees.</p>

<p>Then she went away to another bazar, and there the king&rsquo;s
waz&iacute;r saw her trying to sell her thread. &ldquo;What lovely
thread! Is it for sale?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes, at one hundred
rupees the hank,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Well, I will give you
one hundred rupees. Can I dine with you at your house?&rdquo;
said the waz&iacute;r. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;to-night at
eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the waz&iacute;r; &ldquo;here are the
hundred rupees.&rdquo; And he took the thread and went
away.</p>

<p>The merchant&rsquo;s wife now went to a third bazar, and there
the king&rsquo;s k&aacute;z&iacute; saw her. &ldquo;Is that beautiful thread for
sale?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;for one hundred
and fifty rupees.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will give you the hundred and fifty
rupees. Can I dine with you at your house?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;to-night at twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will come,&rdquo; said the
k&aacute;z&iacute;. &ldquo;Here are one hundred and fifty rupees.&rdquo; So she
took the rupees and gave him the thread.</p>

<p>She set off with the fourth hank to the fourth bazar, and
in this bazar was the king&rsquo;s palace. The king saw her, and
asked if the thread was for sale. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for five
hundred rupees.&rdquo; &ldquo;Give me the thread,&rdquo; said the king;
&ldquo;here are your five hundred rupees. Can I dine with
you at your house?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to-night at two
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she went home and sent one of her servants to the
bazar to buy her four large chests; and she told her other
servants that they were to get ready four very good dinners
for her. Each dinner was to be served in a different room;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
and one was to be ready at ten o&rsquo;clock that night, one at
eleven, one at twelve, and one at two in the morning. The
servant brought her four large chests, and she had them
placed in four different rooms.</p>

<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock the kotw&aacute;l arrived. The merchant&rsquo;s wife
greeted him graciously, and they sat down and dined. After
dinner she said to him, &ldquo;Can you play at cards?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
he answered. She brought some cards, and they sat and
played till the clock struck eleven, when the doorkeeper
came in to say, &ldquo;The waz&iacute;r is here, and wishes to see you.&rdquo;
The kotw&aacute;l was in a dreadful fright. &ldquo;Do hide me somewhere,&rdquo;
he said to her. &ldquo;I have no place where you can
hide in this room,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but in another room I
have a big chest. I will shut you up in that if you like, and
when the waz&iacute;r is gone, I will let you out of it.&rdquo; So she
took him into the next room, and he got into one of the four
big chests, and she shut down the lid and locked it.</p>

<p>Then she bade the doorkeeper bring in the waz&iacute;r, and
they dined together. After dinner she said, &ldquo;Can you play
at cards?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the waz&iacute;r. She took out the cards,
and they played till twelve o&rsquo;clock, when the doorkeeper
came to say the k&aacute;z&iacute; had come to see her. &ldquo;Oh, hide me!
hide me!&rdquo; cried the waz&iacute;r in a great fright. &ldquo;If you come
to another room,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will hide you in a big chest
I have. I can let you out when he is gone.&rdquo; So she
locked the waz&iacute;r up in the second chest.</p>

<p>She and the k&aacute;z&iacute; now dined. Then she said, &ldquo;Can you
play at cards?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the k&aacute;z&iacute;. So they sat playing
at cards till two o&rsquo;clock, when the doorkeeper said the king
had come to see her. &ldquo;Oh, what shall I do?&rdquo; said the
k&aacute;z&iacute;, terribly frightened. &ldquo;Do hide me. Do not let me be
seen by the king.&rdquo; &ldquo;You can hide in a big chest I have in
another room, if you like,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;till he is gone.&rdquo;
And she locked up the k&aacute;z&iacute; in her third chest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
The king now came in, and they dined. &ldquo;Will you play
a little game at cards?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the king.
So they played till three o&rsquo;clock, when the doorkeeper came
running in (just as she had told him to do) to say, &ldquo;My
master&rsquo;s boat has arrived, and he is coming up to the house.
He will be here directly.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now what shall I do?&rdquo;
said the king, who was as frightened as the others had
been. &ldquo;Here is your husband. He must not see me.
You must hide me somewhere.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have no place to
hide you in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but a big chest. You can get into
that if you like, and I will let you out to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
So she shut the lid of the fourth chest down on the king
and locked him up. Then she went to bed, and to sleep,
and slept till morning.</p>

<p>The next day, after she had bathed and dressed, and
eaten her breakfast, and done all her household work, she
said to her servants, &ldquo;I want four coolies.&rdquo; So the servants
went for the coolies; and when they came she showed them
the four chests, and said, &ldquo;Each of you must take one of
these chests on your head and come with me.&rdquo; Then they
set out with her, each carrying a chest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son, the waz&iacute;r&rsquo;s son, the k&aacute;z&iacute;&rsquo;s
son, and the king&rsquo;s son, had been roaming about looking
everywhere for their fathers, and asking every one if they
had seen them, but no one knew anything about them.</p>

<p>The merchant&rsquo;s wife went first to the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s house, and
there she saw the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son. She had the kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s chest
set down on the ground before his door. &ldquo;Will you buy
this chest?&rdquo; she said to his son. &ldquo;What is in it?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;A most precious thing,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;How much do
you want for it?&rdquo; said his son. &ldquo;One thousand rupees,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;and when you open the chest, you will see the
contents are worth two thousand. But you must not open
it till you are in your father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
kotw&aacute;l&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;here are a thousand rupees.&rdquo; The woman
and the other three chests went on their way, while he took
his into the house. &ldquo;What a heavy chest!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;What can be inside?&rdquo; Then he lifted the lid. &ldquo;Why,
there&rsquo;s my father!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Father, how came you to
be in this chest?&rdquo; The kotw&aacute;l was very much ashamed of
himself. &ldquo;I never thought she was the woman to play me
such a trick,&rdquo; he said; and then he had to tell his son the
whole story.</p>

<p>The merchant&rsquo;s wife next stopped at the waz&iacute;r&rsquo;s house,
and there she saw the waz&iacute;r&rsquo;s son. The waz&iacute;r&rsquo;s chest was
put down before his door, and she said to his son, &ldquo;Will
you buy this chest?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is inside of it?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;A most precious thing,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Will you buy
it?&rdquo; &ldquo;How much do you want for it?&rdquo; asked the son.
&ldquo;Only two thousand rupees, and it is worth three thousand.&rdquo;
So the waz&iacute;r&rsquo;s son bought his father, without knowing it, for
two thousand rupees. &ldquo;You must not open the chest till
you are in the house,&rdquo; said the merchant&rsquo;s wife. The waz&iacute;r&rsquo;s
son opened the chest in the house at once, wondering what
could be in it; and the waz&iacute;r&rsquo;s wife stood by all the time.
When they saw the waz&iacute;r himself, looking very much
ashamed, they were greatly astonished. &ldquo;How came you
there?&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; said his
wife. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the waz&iacute;r, &ldquo;I never thought she was a
woman to treat me like this;&rdquo; and he, too, had to tell all
his story.</p>

<p>Now the merchant&rsquo;s wife stopped at the k&aacute;z&iacute;&rsquo;s door, and
there stood the k&aacute;z&iacute;&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Will you buy this chest?&rdquo;
she said to him, and had the k&aacute;z&iacute;&rsquo;s chest put on the ground.
&ldquo;What is in it?&rdquo; said the k&aacute;z&iacute;&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Silver and gold,&rdquo;
she answered. &ldquo;You shall have it for three thousand
rupees. The contents are worth four.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I will take
it,&rdquo; said the son. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t open it till you are in your house,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
she said, and took her three thousand rupees and went
away. Great was the excitement when the k&aacute;z&iacute; stepped
out of the chest. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;I never thought
she could behave like this to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The merchant&rsquo;s wife now went to the palace, and set the
king&rsquo;s chest down at the palace gates. There she saw the
king&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Will you buy this chest?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What
is in it?&rdquo; asked the prince. &ldquo;Diamonds, pearls, and all
kinds of precious stones,&rdquo; said the merchant&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;You
shall have the chest for five thousand rupees, but its contents
are worth a great deal more.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son,
&ldquo;here are your five thousand rupees; give me the chest.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t open it out here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Take it into the
palace and open it there.&rdquo; And away she went home.</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s son opened the chest, and there was his father.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; cried the prince. &ldquo;How came <em>you</em> to
be in the chest?&rdquo; The king was very much ashamed, and
did not tell much about his adventure; but when he was
sitting in his court-house, he had the merchant&rsquo;s wife brought
to him, and gave her a quantity of rupees, saying, &ldquo;You are
a wise and clever woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the kotw&aacute;l knew the waz&iacute;r had gone to see the merchant&rsquo;s
wife; and the waz&iacute;r knew the k&aacute;z&iacute; had gone; and
the k&aacute;z&iacute;, that the king had gone; but this was all that any
of them knew.</p>

<p>The merchant&rsquo;s wife had now plenty of rupees, so she
had a most beautiful well built and roofed over. Then she
locked the door of the well, and told the servants no one
was to drink any of its water, or bathe in it, till her husband
came home: he was to be the first to drink its water, and
bathe in the well.</p>

<p>Then she sent her ayah to the bazar to buy her clothes
and ornaments such as cowherd&rsquo;s wives and daughter&rsquo;s
wear; and when the ayah had brought her these, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
packed them up in a box. Then she dressed herself in
men&rsquo;s clothes, so that no one could tell she was a woman,
and ordered a horse to be got ready for her. &ldquo;I am going
to eat the air of another country for a little while,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You must all take great care of the house while I am away.&rdquo;
The servants did not like her going away at all; they were
afraid her husband might return during her absence, and
that he would be angry with them for having let her go.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is nothing to be
frightened about. I shall come back all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she set out, taking the key of the well, the box with
the clothes her ayah had bought for her in the bazar, and
plenty of rupees. She also took two of her servants. She
travelled a long, long way, asking everywhere for her husband&rsquo;s
boat. At last at the end of a month she came to where
it was. Here she hired a little house, and dressed herself
like a cowherd&rsquo;s daughter. Then she got some very good
milk, and went down to the banks of the river to sell it.
Everybody said, &ldquo;Do look what a beautiful woman that is
selling milk!&rdquo; She sold her milk very quickly, it was so
good. This she did for several days, till her husband, the
merchant, saw her. He thought her so beautiful, that he
asked her to bring him some milk to his boat. So every day
for a little while she sold him milk. One day he said to her,
&ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo; &ldquo;How can I marry you?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You are a merchant, and I am a cowherd&rsquo;s daughter. Soon
you will be leaving this country, and will travel to another
in your boat; you will want me to go with you. Then I
shall have to leave my father and mother, and who will take
care of them?&rdquo; &ldquo;Let us be married,&rdquo; said the merchant.
&ldquo;I am going to stay here for three months. When I go,
you shall return to your father and mother, and later I will
come back to you.&rdquo; To this she agreed, and they were
married, and she went to live in the boat. At the end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
three months, the merchant said to her, &ldquo;My business here
is done, and I must go to another country. Would you
like to go home to your father and mother while I am away?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Here are some rupees for you to live
on in my absence,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do not want any rupees,&rdquo;
said his wife. &ldquo;I only want you to give me two things: your
old cap, and your picture.&rdquo; These he gave her, and then
he went to his boat, and she went back to her own home.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards she had a little son. The servants
were greatly frightened, for they thought their master would
not be pleased when he came home; and he was not pleased
when he did come two months later. He was so cross that
he would not look at the baby-boy, and he would hardly
look at his beautiful well.</p>

<p>One night he lay awake thinking, and he thought he would
kill his wife and her little son. But the next day she came to
him: &ldquo;Tell me the truth,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you are angry with me?
Don&rsquo;t be angry, for I want to show you a picture I like very
much&mdash;the picture of my boy&rsquo;s father.&rdquo; Then she showed him
his own picture, and the old cap he had given her on board
his boat; and she told him how she had been the cowherd&rsquo;s
daughter; and also how she had gained the money to build
his well. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have done all you bade
me. Here is your well, and here is your son.&rdquo; Then the
merchant was very happy. He kissed and loved his little
son, and thought his well was beautiful; and he said to his
wife, &ldquo;What a clever woman you are!&rdquo;</p>

<br />
R&Aacute;J&Aacute; HARICHAND&rsquo;S PUNISHMENT.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxxix">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapt"><span class="dcap">T</span></span>HERE was once a great R&aacute;j&aacute;, R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand, who
every morning before he bathed and breakfasted
used to give away one hundred pounds weight of
gold to the fak&iacute;rs, his poor ryots, and other poor people.
This he did in the name of God, &ldquo;For,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;God
loves me and gives me everything that I have; so daily I
will give him this gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now God heard what a good man R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand was,
and how much the R&aacute;j&aacute; loved him, and he thought he
would go and see for himself if all that was said of the R&aacute;j&aacute;
were true. He therefore went as a fak&iacute;r to R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand&rsquo;s
palace and stood at his gate. The R&aacute;j&aacute; had already given
away his hundred pounds&rsquo; weight of gold, and gone into his
palace and bathed and breakfasted; so when his servants
came to tell him that another fak&iacute;r stood at his gate, the
R&aacute;j&aacute; said, &ldquo;Bid him come to-morrow, for I have bathed,
and have eaten my breakfast, and therefore cannot attend to
him now.&rdquo; The servants returned to the fak&iacute;r, and told him,
&ldquo;The R&aacute;j&aacute; says you must come to-morrow, for he cannot
see you now, as he has bathed and breakfasted.&rdquo; God went
away, and the next day he again came, after all the fak&iacute;rs
and poor people had received their gold and the R&aacute;j&aacute; had
gone into his palace. So the R&aacute;j&aacute; told his servants, &ldquo;Bid
the fak&iacute;r come to-morrow. He has again come too late for
me to see him now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
On the third day God was once more too late, for the
R&aacute;j&aacute; had gone into his palace. The R&aacute;j&aacute; was vexed with
him for being a third time too late, and said to his servants,
&ldquo;What sort of a fak&iacute;r is this that he always comes too late?
Go and ask him what he wants.&rdquo; So the servants went to
the fak&iacute;r and said, &ldquo;R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand says, &lsquo;What do you
want from him?&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;I want no rupees,&rdquo; answered God, &ldquo;nor
anything else; but I want him to give me his wife.&rdquo; The
servants told this to the R&aacute;j&aacute;, and it made him very angry.
He went to his wife, the R&aacute;n&iacute; B&aacute;han, and said to her,
&ldquo;There is a fak&iacute;r at the gate who asks me to give you to
him! As if I should ever do such a thing! Fancy my
giving him my wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The R&aacute;n&iacute; was very wise and clever, for she had a book,
which she read continually, called the kop sh&aacute;stra; and this
book told her everything. So she knew that the fak&iacute;r at the
gate was no fak&iacute;r, but God himself. (In old days about two
people in a thousand, though not more, could read this
book; now-a-days hardly any one can read it, for it is far
too difficult.) So the R&aacute;n&iacute; said to the R&aacute;j&aacute;, &ldquo;Go to this
fak&iacute;r, and say to him, &lsquo;You shall have my wife.&rsquo; You need
not really give me to him; only give me to him in your
thoughts.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will do no such thing,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute; in a
rage; and in spite of all her entreaties, he would not say to
the fak&iacute;r, &ldquo;I will give you my wife.&rdquo; He ordered his servants
to beat the fak&iacute;r, and send him away; and so they did.</p>

<p>God returned to his place, and called to him two angels.
&ldquo;Take the form of men,&rdquo; he said to them, &ldquo;and go to R&aacute;j&aacute;
Harichand. Say to him, &lsquo;God has sent us to you. He
says, Which will you have&mdash;a twelve years&rsquo; famine throughout
your land during which no rain will fall? or a great
rain for twelve hours?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The angels came to the R&aacute;j&aacute; and said as God had bidden
them. The R&aacute;j&aacute; thought for a long while which he should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
choose. &ldquo;If a great rain pours down for twelve hours,&rdquo;
he said to himself, &ldquo;my whole country will be washed away.
But I have a great quantity of gold. I have enough to
send to other countries and buy food for myself and my
ryots during the twelve years&rsquo; famine.&rdquo; So he said to the
angels, &ldquo;I will choose the famine.&rdquo; Then the angels came
into his palace; and the moment they entered it, all the
R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s servants that were in the palace, and all his cows,
horses, elephants, and other animals became stone. So did
every single thing in the palace, excepting his gold and silver,
and these turned to charcoal. The R&aacute;j&aacute; and R&aacute;n&iacute; did not
become stone.</p>

<p>The angels said to them, &ldquo;For three weeks you will not
be able to eat anything; you will not be able to eat any
food you may find or may have given you. But you will
not die, you will live.&rdquo; Then the angels went away.</p>

<p>The R&aacute;j&aacute; was very sad when he looked round his palace and
saw everything in it, and all the people in it, stone, and saw all
his gold and silver turned to charcoal. He said to his wife,
&ldquo;I cannot stay here. I must go to some other country. I was
a great R&aacute;j&aacute;; how can I ask my ryots to give me food? We
will dress ourselves like fak&iacute;rs, and go to another country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They put on fak&iacute;rs&rsquo; clothes and went out of their palace.
They wandered in the jungle till they saw a plum-tree
covered with fruit. &ldquo;Do gather some of those plums for me,&rdquo;
said the R&aacute;n&iacute;, who was very hungry. The R&aacute;j&aacute; went to the
tree and put out his hand to gather the plums; but when
he did this, they at once all left the tree and went a little way
up into the air. When he drew back his hand, the plums
returned to the tree. The R&aacute;j&aacute; tried three times to gather
the plums, but never could do so.</p>

<p>He and the R&aacute;n&iacute; then went on till they came to a plain
in another country, where was a large tank in which men
were fishing. The R&aacute;n&iacute; said to her husband, &ldquo;Go and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
ask those men to give us a little of their fish, for I am very
hungry.&rdquo; The R&aacute;j&aacute; went to the men and said, &ldquo;I am a fak&iacute;r,
and have no pice. Will you give me some of your fish,
for I have not eaten for four days and am hungry?&rdquo; The
men gave him some fish, and he and his wife carried it to a
tank on another plain. The R&aacute;n&iacute; cleaned and prepared the
fish for cooking, and said to her husband, &ldquo;I have nothing
in which to cook this fish. Go up to the town (there was a
town close by) and ask some one to give you an earthen pot
with a lid, and some salt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The R&aacute;j&aacute; went up to the town, and some one in the bazar
gave him the earthen pot, and a grain merchant put a little
salt into it. Then he returned to the R&aacute;n&iacute;, and they made a
fire under a tree, put the fish into the pot, and set the pot on
the fire. &ldquo;I have not bathed for some days,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;j&aacute;.
&ldquo;I will go and bathe while you cook the fish, and when I
come back we will eat it.&rdquo; So he went to bathe, and the R&aacute;n&iacute;
sat watching the fish. Presently she thought, &ldquo;If I leave
the lid on the pot, the fish will dry up and burn.&rdquo; Then she
took off the lid, and the fish instantly jumped out of the pot
into the tank and swam away. This made the R&aacute;n&iacute; sad; but
she sat there quiet and silent. When the R&aacute;j&aacute; had bathed,
he returned to his wife, and said, &ldquo;Now we will eat our fish.&rdquo;
The R&aacute;n&iacute; answered, &ldquo;I had not eaten for four days, and
was very hungry, so I ate all the fish.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said
the R&aacute;j&aacute;, &ldquo;it does not matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They wandered on, and the next day came to another
jungle where they saw two pigeons. The R&aacute;j&aacute; took some
grass and sticks, and made a bow and arrow. He shot the
pigeons with these, and the R&aacute;n&iacute; plucked and cleaned
them. Her husband and she made a little fire, put the
pigeons in their pot, and set them on it. There was a tank
near. &ldquo;Now I will go and bathe,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;n&iacute;; &ldquo;I have
not bathed for some days. When I come back, we will eat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
the pigeons.&rdquo; So she went to bathe, and the R&aacute;j&aacute; sat down
to watch the pigeons. Presently he thought, &ldquo;If I leave the
pot shut, the birds will dry up and burn.&rdquo; So he took off the
lid, and instantly away flew the pigeons out of the pot. He
guessed at once what the fish had done yesterday, and sat
still and silent till the R&aacute;n&iacute; came back. &ldquo;I have eaten the
pigeons in the same way that you ate the fish yesterday,&rdquo;
he said to her. The R&aacute;n&iacute; understood what had happened,
and saw the R&aacute;j&aacute; knew how the fish had escaped.</p>

<p>So they wandered on; and as they went the R&aacute;n&iacute; remembered
an oil merchant, called Gang&aacute; T&eacute;l&iacute;, a friend of theirs,
and a great man, just like a R&aacute;j&aacute;. &ldquo;Let us go to Gang&aacute;
T&eacute;l&iacute;, if we can walk as far as his house,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He will
be good to us.&rdquo; He lived a long way off. When they got
to him, Gang&aacute; T&eacute;l&iacute; knew them at once. &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You were a great R&aacute;j&aacute;; why are you
and the R&aacute;n&iacute; so poor and dressed like fak&iacute;rs?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is God&rsquo;s
will,&rdquo; they answered. Gang&aacute; T&eacute;l&iacute; did not think it worth
while to notice them much now they were poor; so, though
he did not send them away, he gave them a wretched room
to live in, a wretched bed to lie on, and such bad food to eat
that, hungry as they were, they could not touch it. &ldquo;When
we were rich,&rdquo; they said to each other, &ldquo;and came to stay
with Gang&aacute; T&eacute;l&iacute;, he received us like friends; he gave us
beautiful rooms to live in, beautiful beds to lie on, and delicious
food to eat. We cannot stay here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they went away very sorrowful, and wandered for a
whole week, and all the time they had no food, till they came
to another country whose R&aacute;j&aacute;, R&aacute;j&aacute; Bhoj, was one of their
friends. R&aacute;j&aacute; Bhoj received them very kindly. &ldquo;What has
brought you to this state? How is it you are so poor?&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;What has happened to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is God&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; they
answered. R&aacute;j&aacute; Bhoj gave them a beautiful room to live
in, and told his servants to cook for them the very nicest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
dinner they could. This the servants did, and they brought
the dinner into R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand&rsquo;s room, and set it before
him and left him. Then he and the R&aacute;n&iacute; put some of the
food on their plates; but before they could eat anything, the
food both in the dishes and on their plates became full of
maggots. So they could not eat it. They felt greatly
humbled. However, they said nothing, but worshipped God;
and they buried all the food in a hole they dug in the floor
of their room.</p>

<p>Now the daughter of R&aacute;j&aacute; Bhoj had left her gold necklace
hanging on the wall of the room in which were R&aacute;j&aacute;
Harichand and the R&aacute;n&iacute; B&aacute;han. At night when R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand
was asleep, the R&aacute;n&iacute; saw a crack come in the wall
and the necklace go of itself into the crack; then the wall
joined together as before. She at once woke her husband,
and told him what she had seen. &ldquo;We had better go away
quickly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The necklace will not be found to-morrow,
and R&aacute;j&aacute; Bhoj will think we are thieves. It will be
useless breaking the wall open to find it.&rdquo; The R&aacute;j&aacute; got up
at once, and they set out again. R&aacute;j&aacute; Bhoj, when the necklace
was not found, thought R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand and the R&aacute;n&iacute;
B&aacute;han had stolen it.</p>

<p>They wandered on till they came to a country belonging
to another friend, called R&aacute;j&aacute; Nal, but they were
ashamed to go to his palace. The three weeks were now
nearly over, only two more days were left. So the R&aacute;n&iacute;
said, &ldquo;In two days we shall be able to eat. Go into the
jungle and cut grass, and sell it in the bazar. We shall
thus get a few pice and be able to buy a little food.&rdquo; The
R&aacute;j&aacute; went out to the jungle, but he had to break and pull
up the grass with his hands. He worked half the day, and
then sold the grass in the bazar for a few pice. They were
able to buy food, and worshipped God and cooked it; and
as the three weeks were now over they were allowed to eat it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
They stayed in R&aacute;j&aacute; Nal&rsquo;s country, and lived in a little
house they hired in the bazar. R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand went out
every day to the jungle for grass, which he pulled up or
broke off with his hands, and then sold in the bazar for a
few pice. The R&aacute;n&iacute; saved a pice or two whenever she
could, and at the end of two years they were rich enough
to buy a hook such as grass-cutters use. The R&aacute;j&aacute; could
now cut more grass, and soon the R&aacute;n&iacute; was able to buy
some pretty-coloured silks in the bazar.</p>

<p>Her husband went daily to cut grass, and she sat at home
making head-collars with the silks for horses. Four years
after they had bought the hook, she had four of these head-collars
ready, and she took them up to R&aacute;j&aacute; Nal&rsquo;s palace to
sell. It was the first time she had gone there, for she and
her husband were ashamed to see R&aacute;j&aacute; Nal. Their fak&iacute;rs&rsquo;
dresses had become rags, and they had only been able to get
wretched common clothes in their place, for they were
miserably poor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What beautiful head-collars these are!&rdquo; said R&aacute;j&aacute; Nal&rsquo;s
coachmen and grooms; and they took them to show to their
R&aacute;j&aacute;. As soon as he saw them he said, &ldquo;Where did you get
these head-collars? Who is it that wishes to sell them?&rdquo;
for he knew that only one woman could make such head-collars,
and that woman was the R&aacute;n&iacute; B&aacute;han. &ldquo;A very
poor woman brought them here just now,&rdquo; they answered.
&ldquo;Bring her to me,&rdquo; said R&aacute;j&aacute; Nal. So the servants brought
him R&aacute;n&iacute; B&aacute;han, and when she saw the R&aacute;j&aacute; she burst into
tears. &ldquo;What has brought you to this state? Why are you
so poor?&rdquo; said R&aacute;j&aacute; Nal. &ldquo;It is God&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;Where is your husband?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;He is cutting grass
in the jungle,&rdquo; she said. R&aacute;j&aacute; Nal called his servants and
said, &ldquo;Go into the jungle, and there you will see a man
cutting grass. Bring him to me.&rdquo; When R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand
saw R&aacute;j&aacute; Nal&rsquo;s servants coming to him, he was very much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
frightened; but the servants took him and brought him to
the palace. As soon as R&aacute;j&aacute; Nal saw his old friend, he
seized his hands, and burst out crying. &ldquo;R&aacute;j&aacute;,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;what has brought you to this state?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is God&rsquo;s will,&rdquo;
said R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand.</p>

<p>R&aacute;j&aacute; Nal was very good to them. He gave them a palace
to live in, and servants to wait on them; beautiful clothes
to wear, and good food to eat. He went with them to the
palace to see that everything was as it should be for them.
&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; he said to the R&aacute;n&iacute;, &ldquo;I shall dine with your
husband, and you must give me a dinner cooked just as
you used to cook one for me when I went to see you in
your own country.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good, I will give it you,&rdquo; said the
R&aacute;n&iacute;; but she was quite frightened, for she thought, &ldquo;The
R&aacute;j&aacute; is so kind, and everything is so comfortable for us, that
I am sure something dreadful will happen.&rdquo; However, she
prepared the dinner, and told the servants how to cook it
and serve it; but first she worshipped God, and entreated
him to have mercy on her and her husband. The dinner
was very good, and nothing evil happened to any one.
They lived in the palace R&aacute;j&aacute; Nal gave them for four and a
half years.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the farmers in R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand&rsquo;s country had
all these years gone on ploughing and turning up the land,
although not a drop of rain had fallen all that time, and
the earth was hard and dry. Now just when the R&aacute;j&aacute; and
R&aacute;n&iacute; had lived in R&aacute;j&aacute; Nal&rsquo;s palace for four and a half years
Mah&aacute;deo was walking through R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand&rsquo;s country.
He saw the farmers digging up the ground, and said,
&ldquo;What is the good of your digging and turning up the
ground? Not a drop of rain is going to fall.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said
the farmers, &ldquo;but if we did not go on ploughing and
digging, we should forget how to do our work.&rdquo; They did
not know they were talking to Mah&aacute;deo, for he looked like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
a man. &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Mah&aacute;deo, and he thought, &ldquo;The
farmers speak the truth; and if I go on neglecting to
blow on my horn, I shall forget how to blow on it at
all.&rdquo; So he took his deer&rsquo;s horn, which was just like those
some yog&iacute;s use, and blew on it. Now when R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand
had chosen the twelve years&rsquo; famine, God had said, &ldquo;Rain
shall not fall on R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand&rsquo;s country till Mah&aacute;deo
blows his horn in it.&rdquo; Mah&aacute;deo had quite forgotten this
decree; so he blew on his horn, although only ten and a
half years&rsquo; famine had gone by. The moment he blew,
down came the rain, and the whole country at once became
as it had been before the famine began; and moreover, the
moment it rained, everything in R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand&rsquo;s palace
became what it was before the angels entered it. All the
men and women came to life again; so did all the animals;
and the gold and silver were no longer charcoal, but once
more gold and silver. God was not angry with Mah&aacute;deo for
forgetting that he said the famine should last for twelve years,
and that the rain should fall when Mah&aacute;deo blew on his
horn in R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand&rsquo;s country. &ldquo;If it pleased Mah&aacute;deo
to blow on his horn,&rdquo; said God, &ldquo;it does not matter that
eighteen months of famine were still to last.&rdquo; As soon as
they heard the rain had fallen, all the ryots who had gone
to other countries on account of the famine returned to R&aacute;j&aacute;
Harichand&rsquo;s country.</p>

<p>Among the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s servants was the kotw&aacute;l, and very
anxious he was, when he came to life again, to find the
R&aacute;j&aacute; and R&aacute;n&iacute;; only he did not know how to do so, and
wondered where he had best seek for them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the R&aacute;n&iacute; B&aacute;han had a dream that God sent
her, in which an angel said to her, &ldquo;It is good that you
and your husband should return to your country.&rdquo; She told
this dream to her husband; and R&aacute;j&aacute; Nal gave them horses,
elephants, and camels, that they might travel like R&aacute;j&aacute;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
to their home, and he went with them. They found everything
in order in their own palace and all through their
country, and after this lived very happily in it. But the
R&aacute;n&iacute; said to R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand, &ldquo;If you had only done what I
told you, and said you would give me to the fak&iacute;r, all this
misery would not have come on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later they went to stay again with R&aacute;j&aacute; Bhoj, and slept
in the same room as they had had when they came to him
poor and wretched. In the night they saw the wall open,
and the necklace came out of the crack and hung itself up
as before, and the wall closed again. The next day they
showed the necklace to R&aacute;j&aacute; Bhoj, saying, &ldquo;It was on
account of this necklace that we ran away from you the
last time we were here,&rdquo; and they told him all that had
happened to it.</p>

<p>As for Gang&aacute; T&eacute;l&iacute;, they never went near him again.</p>

<br />
THE KING&rsquo;S SON AND THE WAZ&Iacute;R&rsquo;S
DAUGHTER.</h2>


<p><span class="link"><a href="#nxxx">To&nbsp;notes</a></span><span class="dcapi"><span class="dcap">I</span></span>N a country there was a great king who had a waz&iacute;r.
One day he thought he should like to play at cards
with this waz&iacute;r, and he told him to go and get some
for him, and then play a game with him. So the waz&iacute;r brought
the cards, and he and the king sat down to play. Now
neither the king nor the waz&iacute;r had any children; and as
they were playing, the king said, &ldquo;Waz&iacute;r, if I have a son
and you have a daughter, or if I have a daughter and you have
a son, let us marry our children to each other.&rdquo; To this
the waz&iacute;r agreed. A year after the king had a son; and
when the boy was two years old, the waz&iacute;r had a daughter.
Some years passed, and the king&rsquo;s son was twelve years old,
and the waz&iacute;r&rsquo;s daughter ten. Then the king said to the
waz&iacute;r, &ldquo;Do you remember how one day, when we were
playing at cards, we agreed to marry our children to each
other?&rdquo; &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said the waz&iacute;r. &ldquo;Let us marry
them now,&rdquo; said the king. So they held the wedding feast;
but the waz&iacute;r&rsquo;s little daughter remained in her father&rsquo;s house
because she was still so young.</p>

<p>As the king&rsquo;s son grew older he became very wicked,
and took to gambling and drinking till his father and
mother died of grief. After their death he went on in the
same way, gambling and drinking, until he had no money
left, and had to leave the palace, and live anywhere he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
could in the town, wandering from house to house in a
fak&iacute;r&rsquo;s dress, begging his bread, and sleeping wherever he
found a spot on which to lie down.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the waz&iacute;r&rsquo;s daughter was living alone, for her
husband had never come to fetch her as he should have done
when she was old enough. Her father and mother were
dead too. She had given half of the money they left her
to the poor, and she lived on the other half. She spent
her days in praying to God, and in reading in a holy book;
and though she was so young, she was very wise and good.</p>

<p>One day, as the prince was roaming about in his fak&iacute;r&rsquo;s
rags, not knowing where to find food or shelter, he remembered
his wife, and thought he would go and see her. She
ordered her servants to give him good food, a bath, and
good clothes; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we were married when we
were children, though he never fetched me to his palace.&rdquo;
The servants did as she bade them. The prince bathed and
dressed, and ate food, and he wished to stay with his wife.
But she said, &ldquo;No; before you stay with me you must
see four sights. Go out in the jungle and walk for a whole
week. Then you will come to a plain where you will see
them.&rdquo; So the next day he set out for the plain, and reached
it in one week.</p>

<p>There he saw a large tank. At one corner of the tank he
saw a man and a woman who had good clothes, good food,
good beds, and servants to wait on them, and seemed very
happy. At the second corner he saw a wretchedly poor
man and his wife, who did nothing but cry and sob because
they had no food to eat, no water to drink, no bed to lie on,
no one to take care of them. At the third corner he saw
two little fishes that were always going up and down in the
air. They would shoot down close to the water, but they
could not go into it or stay in it; then they would make
a salaam to God, and would shoot up again into the air, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
before they got very high, they had to drop down again.
At the fourth corner he saw a huge demon who was heating
sand in an enormous iron pot, under which he kept up a
big fire.</p>

<p>The prince returned to his wife, and told her all he had
seen. &ldquo;Do you know who the happy man and woman
are?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;They are my father
and mother,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When they were alive, I was good
to them, and since their death I gave half their money to
the poor; and on the other half I have lived quietly, and
tried to be good. So God is pleased with them, and
makes them happy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; said her husband.
&ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And the miserable man and
woman who did nothing but cry, do you know who they
are?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;They are your father and
mother. When they were alive, you gambled and drank;
and they died of grief. Then you went on gambling and
drinking till you had spent all their money. So now God is
angry with them, and will not make them happy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is that
true?&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And the
fishes you saw were the two little children we should have had
if you had taken me to your home as your wife. Now they
cannot be born, for they can find no bodies in which to be
born; so God has ordered them to rise and sink in the air
in these fishes&rsquo; forms.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; asked the prince.
&ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;And by God&rsquo;s order the
demon you saw is heating that sand in the big iron pot for
you, because you are such a wicked man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moment she had told all this to her husband, she
died. But he did not get any better. He gambled and
drank all her money away, and lived a wretched life,
wandering about like a fak&iacute;r till his death.</p>

<h2>NOTES.</h2>


<h3 class="smlpadt">INTRODUCTORY.</h3>

<p><span class="dcapi"><span class="dcap">I</span></span>N these stories the word translated God, is <i>Khud&aacute;</i>.
Excepting in &ldquo;How king Burtal became a Fak&iacute;r&rdquo;
(p. <a href="#Page_85">85</a>), and in &ldquo;R&aacute;j&aacute; Harichand&rsquo;s Punishment&rdquo;
(p. <a href="#Page_224">224</a>), in which Mah&aacute;deo plays a part, the tellers of these
tales would never specify by name the god they spoke of.
He was always <i>Khud&aacute;</i>, &ldquo;the great <i>Khud&aacute;</i> who lives up there
in the sky.&rdquo; In this they differed from the narrator of the
<i>Old Deccan Days</i> stories, who almost always gives her gods
and goddesses their Hind&uacute; names&mdash;probably because, from
being a Christian, she had no religious scruples to deter her
from so doing.</p>

<p>When the heroes of these stories are called R&aacute;j&aacute;s, the
word R&aacute;j&aacute; has been kept: when they are called B&aacute;dsh&aacute;hs,
we have called them kings. The Ayahs say, &ldquo;A B&aacute;dsh&aacute;h is a
much greater man than a R&aacute;j&aacute;.&rdquo; When <i>b&aacute;dsh&aacute;h</i> (the Persian
<i>p&aacute;dish&aacute;h</i>) in its corrupted form of <i>b&aacute;s&aacute;</i> is tacked on to a proper
name, such as <i>An&aacute;r</i> (<i>An&aacute;rb&aacute;s&aacute;</i>), <i>H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;l</i> (<i>H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;lb&aacute;s&aacute;</i>),
the <i>b&aacute;s&aacute;</i> has been preserved, because, Dunkn&iacute; says, in these
cases <i>b&aacute;s&aacute;</i> is no longer a title, but part of the proper name.</p>

<p>Old M&uacute;niy&aacute; tells her stories with the solemn, authoritative
air of a professor. She sits quite still on the floor, and uses
no gestures. Dunkn&iacute; gets thoroughly excited over her tales,
marches up and down the room, acting her stories, as it were.
For instance, in describing the thickness of Mah&aacute;deo&rsquo;s hair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
in King Burtal&rsquo;s story, she put her two thumbs to her ears,
and spread out all her fingers from her head saying, &ldquo;His
hair stood out like this,&rdquo; and in &ldquo;Loving Lail&iacute;,&rdquo; after moving
her hand as if she were pulling the magic knife from her
pocket and unfolding it, she swung her arm out at full length
with great energy, and then she said, &ldquo;Lail&iacute; made one
&lsquo;touch&rsquo;&rdquo; (here she brought back the edge of her hand to her
own throat), &ldquo;and the head fell off.&rdquo; Dunkn&iacute; sometimes used
an English word, such as the &ldquo;touch&rdquo; in the present case.</p>

<p>All these stories were read back in Hind&uacute;st&aacute;n&iacute; by my little
girl to the tellers at the time of telling, and nearly all a
second time by me this winter before printing. I never saw
people more anxious to have their tales retold exactly than
are Dunkn&iacute; and M&uacute;niy&aacute;. Not till each tale was pronounced
by them to be <i>th&iacute;k</i> (exact) was it sent to the press.</p>

<p>It is strange in these Indian tales to meet golden-haired,
fair-complexioned heroes and heroines. Mr. Thornton tells
me that in the Panj&aacute;b when one native speaks of another
with contempt, he says, &ldquo;he is a black man,&rdquo; <i>ek k&aacute;l&aacute; &aacute;dm&iacute;
hai</i>. Sir Neville Chamberlain tells me that if you wish to
praise a native for his valour and brave conduct, you say to
him, &ldquo;Your countenance is red,&rdquo; or &ldquo;your cheeks are red,&rdquo;
and that nothing is worse than to tell him his &ldquo;face is black.&rdquo;
And this is what Mr. Boxwell says about the expression
&ldquo;k&aacute;l&aacute; &aacute;dm&iacute;&rdquo; and our fairy tales:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;The stories are of the Aryan conquerors from beyond the
Indus; distinguished by their fair skin from the dark aborigines
of India. In Vedic times Var&#7751;a, &lsquo;colour,&rsquo; is used for stock
or blood, as the Latins used Nomen. It is in India &lsquo;Yas
D&aacute;sam var&#7751;am adharam guh&aacute;kar.&rsquo; &lsquo;Who sank in darkness the
Barbarian colour.&rsquo; R.&nbsp;V. II. 4.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indra, again, &lsquo;Hatv&eacute; Dasy&uacute;n pra &Aacute;ryam var&#7751;am &aacute;vat.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Having slain the Barbarians, helped the Aryan colour.&rsquo; R.&nbsp;V.
III. 34.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
&ldquo;Again, in K. V. I. 104. They pray&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Te nas &aacute;vaksa suvit&aacute;ya var&#7751;am.&rsquo; &lsquo;May they bring our
colour to success.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In later times &lsquo;var&#7751;a&rsquo; is the regular word for caste; and
the Brahmins and the rest of the twice-born who still represent
the Aryan var&#7751;a are much fairer than the &Ccedil;&uacute;dras and Hill
people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Ikhw&aacute;n ussafa the black skin is one of the results of
the Fall to Adam and Hawa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&Aacute;ft&aacute;b ki garm&iacute; se rang mutaghaiyar aur si&aacute;h ho gay&aacute;.&rsquo;
&lsquo;From the heat of the sun their colour became changed and
black.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>But I think the fact that the conquering races that invaded
India from the north were fair and ruddier than the aborigines,
and that their descendants, the high-caste natives, are
to this day fairer than the aborigines, though it explains the
phrases, &ldquo;he is only a black man,&rdquo; and &ldquo;your cheeks are
red,&rdquo; does not account for the golden hair and fair skin of
so many of our princes and princesses. I believe that they
all owe their characteristics to the fact that such are the
characteristics of the solar hero, although they cannot all lay
claim to a solar origin for themselves. For this golden hair
and white skin, at first the property of the shining sun-hero
alone, would naturally in the course of time be given to
other Indian folk-lore heroes on whose beauty and brightness
it was necessary to lay a stress. Prince Majn&uacute;n, for instance,
certainly has nothing solar about him, yet his hair is described
as red. Dunkn&iacute;, in answer to a half incredulous,
half inquiring exclamation of mine when I heard this,
asserted, &ldquo;Red! yes, it was red: red like gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The black-haired Maoris give their sea-nymphs yellow hair
(<i>Old New Zealand</i>, p. 19); and Sir George Grey in his
<i>Polynesian Mythology</i>, p. 295, writes thus of the Maori
fairies: &ldquo;Their appearance is that of human beings, nearly
resembling an European&rsquo;s; their hair being very fair, and so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
is their skin. They are very different from the Maoris, and
do not resemble them at all.&rdquo; But as the Maoris do not
seem to have any myths of golden-haired solar heroes, these
peculiarities of hair and complexion cannot be referred to
the same cause as those of my little daughter&rsquo;s Indian
princes and princesses.</p>


<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="ni" id="ni"></a>I.&mdash;PH&Uacute;LMATI R&Aacute;N&Iacute;.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#si">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. Ph&uacute;lmati is a garden rose, not a wild rose. It must be
a local name for the flower. I can find it in no dictionary.
Dunkn&iacute; says her heroine was named after a pink rose.</p>

<p>2. She has hair of pure gold. Compare in this book: Princess
Jah&uacute;ran, p. <a href="#Page_43">43</a>, the Monkey Prince, p. <a href="#Page_50">50</a>, Sonahr&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;, p. <a href="#Page_54">54</a>,
Jah&uacute;r R&aacute;n&iacute;, p. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>, Prince D&iacute;m&aacute;-ahmad and Princess At&aacute;sa,
Notes, p. <a href="#Page_253">253</a>. Also, H&iacute;ra Bai, the cobra&rsquo;s daughter in <i>Old Deccan
Days</i>, p. 35. So many princely heroes and heroines in European
fairy tales are noteworthy for their dazzling golden hair that I
will only mention one of them, Princess Golden-Hair, one of
whose hairs rings if it falls to the ground&mdash;see Naake&rsquo;s <i>Slavonic
Fairy Tales</i>, p. 100. And devils being fallen heroes or angels, the
following references may be made to them. In Haltrich&rsquo;s <i>Siebenbuergische
Maerchen</i>, p. 171, in &ldquo;Die beiden Fleischhauer in der
Hoelle,&rdquo; the devil&rsquo;s grandmother gives the good brother a hair
that had fallen from the devil&rsquo;s head while he slept. The man
carries it home and the hair suddenly becomes as big as a
&ldquo;Heubaum&rdquo; and is &ldquo;of pure gold.&rdquo; Also in one of Grimm&rsquo;s
stories the hero is sent to fetch three golden hairs from the devil&rsquo;s
head&mdash;see <i>Kinder und Hausmaerchen</i>, vol. I. p. 175, &ldquo;Der
Teufel mit den drei goldenen Haaren.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3. Her beauty lights up a dark room. In this shining quality
she resembles many Asiatic and European fairy-tale heroes
and heroines. See in this book H&iacute;r&aacute;l&iacute;, whose face shone like a
diamond, p. <a href="#Page_69">69</a>; and the Princess Lab&aacute;m, who shone like the
moon, and her beauty made night day, p. <a href="#Page_158">158</a>. In <i>Old Deccan
Days</i>, p. 156, the prince&rsquo;s dead body on the hedge of spears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
dazzles those who look at it till they can hardly see. P&aacute;nch Ph&uacute;l
R&aacute;n&iacute;, p. 140, shines in the dark jungle like a star. So does the
princess in Chundun R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s dark tomb, p. 229. In a Din&aacute;jpur
story published by Mr. G.&nbsp;H. Damant in the <i>Indian Antiquary</i>
for February 1875, vol. IV. p. 54, the dream-nymph,
Tillottama, whenever she appears, lights up the whole place
with her beauty. &ldquo;At every breath she drew when she slept, a
flame like a flower issued from her nostril, and when she drew in
her breath the flower of flame was again withdrawn.&rdquo; Her
beauty lit up her house &ldquo;as if by lightning.&rdquo; See Appendix
<i>A</i>. In Naake&rsquo;s <i>Slavonic Fairy Tales</i>, p. 96, is the Bohemian
tale quoted above of Princess Golden-Hair. &ldquo;Every morning
at break of day she [the princess] combs her golden locks;
its brightness is reflected in the sea, and up among the
clouds,&rdquo; p. 102. When she let it down &ldquo;it was bright as
the rising sun,&rdquo; and almost blinded Irik with its radiance,
p. 107. The golden children (Schott&rsquo;s <i>Wallachische Maerchen</i>,
p. 125) shine in the darkened room &ldquo;like the morning sun in
May.&rdquo; Gubernatis in the 2nd vol. of his <i>Zoological Mythology</i>,
mentions at p. 31 a golden boy who figures in one of
Afanassieff&rsquo;s stories; when this child&rsquo;s body is uncovered on his
restoration to his father, &ldquo;all the room shines with light.&rdquo; And
at p. 57 of the same volume he quotes another of Afanassieff&rsquo;s
stories, in which the persecuted princess has three sons &ldquo;who
light up whatever is near them with their splendour.&rdquo; Of Gerd
in J&ouml;tunheim, the beautiful giant maiden with the bright shining
arms, Thorpe says (<i>Northern Mythology</i>, vol. I. p. 47), when
she raised &ldquo;her arms to open the door, both air and water gave
such a reflection that the whole world was illumined.&rdquo; The
boar Trwyth (who was once a king, but because of his sons was
turned into a boar) after his fall preserves some of his old kingly
splendour; for &ldquo;his bristles were like silver wire, and whether he
went through the wood or through the plain he was to be traced
by the glittering of his bristles&rdquo; (<i>Mabinogion</i>, vol. II. p. 310). In
the same work (vol. III. p. 279), in &ldquo;The Dream of Maxen
Wledig,&rdquo; is a maiden, of whom it is told: &ldquo;Not more easy than
to gaze upon the sun when brightest was it to look upon her by
reason of her beauty.&rdquo; And in &ldquo;Goldhaar&rdquo; (Haltrich&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
<i>Siebenbuergische Maerchen</i>, p. 61) when the hero&rsquo;s cap fell off he stood
there &ldquo;in all splendour and his golden locks fell round his head,
and he shone like the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a Santhali tale published by the Rev. F.&nbsp;T. Cole in the
<i>Indian Antiquary</i> for January 1875, p. 10, called &ldquo;Toria the
Goatherd and the Daughter of the Sun,&rdquo; a beggar&rsquo;s eyes are as
dazzled by the Sun&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s beauty &ldquo;as if he had stared at
the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>4. Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute; has on her head the sun, on her hands
moons, and her face is covered with stars. Compare in these
stories &ldquo;The Indr&aacute;san R&aacute;j&aacute;,&rdquo; p. <a href="#Page_1">1</a>, &ldquo;The boy who had a moon
on his forehead and a star on his chin,&rdquo; p. <a href="#Page_119">119</a>, and &ldquo;Prince
D&iacute;m&aacute;-ahmad and Princess At&aacute;sa,&rdquo; Notes, p. <a href="#Page_253">253</a>. In Fr&auml;ulein
Gonzenbach&rsquo;s <i>Sicilian Fairy Tales</i>, No. 5 (vol. I. p. 21), the
king&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s children are born, the boy with a golden apple in his
hand, the girl with a star on her forehead. In the Notes to this
story (vol. II. p. 207) Herr K&ouml;hler mentions a Tyrolean fairy
tale, &ldquo;Zingerle, II. p. 112,&rdquo; where the king&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s daughter has
a golden apple in her hand, and her brother a golden star on
his forehead. In Milenowsky&rsquo;s <i>Bohemian Fairy Tales</i>, p. 1, is
the story &ldquo;Von den Sternprinzen&rdquo; in which the king&rsquo;s son by the
queen has a gold star on his forehead, and his son by the old
woman has a silver star, p. 2. These princes&rsquo; children also are
born with gold and silver stars on their foreheads, p. 30. In a
Hungarian tale, &ldquo;Die verwandelten Kinder,&rdquo; the old man&rsquo;s
youngest daughter promises, and keeps her promise, to give the
king, if he marries her, twin sons, who will be most beautiful,
will have golden hair, and each a golden ring on his arm; further,
one is to have a planet, the other a sun on his forehead&mdash;Stier&rsquo;s
<i>Ungarische Volksmaerchen</i>, p. 57. Also in the same
author&rsquo;s <i>Ungarische Sagen und Maerchen</i> in &ldquo;Die beiden
juengsten Koenigskinder,&rdquo; the hero wins a bride (p. 77) who has
a sun on her forehead, a moon on her right, and three stars on
her left, breast. In &ldquo;Eisenlaci&rdquo; in the same collection the
snake-king&rsquo;s daughter has a star on her forehead (p. 109).
Gubernatis (<i>Zoological Mythology</i>, vol. I. p. 412) says, &ldquo;In the
seventh story of the third book of Afanassieff, the queen bears
two sons; one has a moon on his forehead and the other a star
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
on the nape of his neck. Her wicked sister buries them; a
golden and a silver sprout spring up which a sheep eats and then
has two lambs, one with a moon on its head, the other with a
star on its neck. The wicked sister who has married the king
orders them to be torn in pieces, and their intestines to be thrown
into the road. The good, lawful queen eats them and again
gives birth to her sons.&rdquo; Gubernatis in the 2nd volume of the
same work, p. 31, quotes another of Afanassieff&rsquo;s stories, the
thirteenth of the third book, in which a merchant&rsquo;s wife has a
son &ldquo;whose body is all of gold, effigies of stars, moon, and sun
covered it.&rdquo; This is the gold boy mentioned in the preceding
paragraph as lighting up the room when his body was uncovered.
In &ldquo;Das Schwarze Lamm,&rdquo; the empress bears a son with a
golden star on his forehead (Karadschitsch, <i>Volksmaerchen der
Serben</i>, p. 177).</p>

<p>5. Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute; weighs but one flower: compare P&aacute;nch
Ph&uacute;l R&aacute;n&iacute; in <i>Old Deccan Days</i>, p. 133.</p>

<p>6. Indr&aacute;san (= Indra + &Aacute;sana, Indra&rsquo;s throne or home), says
Dunkn&iacute;, is the name of the underground fairy country. Its
inhabitants, the fairies (par&iacute;) are called the Indr&aacute;san people;
they delight in all lovely things; everything about them is
beautiful; they play exquisitely on all kinds of musical instruments;
they dance and sing a great deal; they have wings and
can fly. They taught the little Monkey Prince (p. <a href="#Page_42">42</a>), and
King Burtal&rsquo;s eldest son was taken to them as a pupil by the
fak&iacute;r Gorakn&aacute;th, p. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>. In Indr&aacute;san grows a tree of which no
man can ever see the flowers or fruit, as the fairies gather them
in the night and take them away. The Irish &ldquo;good people&rdquo;
who live in clefts of rocks, caves, and mounds, and the Irish
fairies who live in the beautiful land of youth under the sea,
have many points in common with the Indian fairies. They,
too, dance beautifully, are wonderful musicians, and have everything
about them lovely and splendid. The &ldquo;good people&rdquo;
also sometimes impart their knowledge to mortals. See pp. x,
xii, and xviii of the Introduction to the <i>Irische Elfenmaerchen</i>
translated into German by the brothers Grimm. Some of the
Cornish fairies, the Small People, like the Indr&aacute;san people, live
underground (Hunt&rsquo;s <i>Romances and Drolls of the West of England</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
pp. 116, 118, 125), aid those to whom they take a fancy
and are very playful among themselves (<i>ib.</i> p. 81); they have
the most ravishing music (<i>ib.</i> pp. 86, 98); their singing is clear
and delicate as silver bells (<i>ib.</i> p. 100); everything about them
is joyous and beautiful (<i>ib.</i> pp. 86, 99, 100); they are a tiny race
(<i>ib.</i> p. 81), but can at pleasure take the size of human beings (<i>ib.</i>
pp. 115, 122, 123); and their queen has hair &ldquo;like gold threads&rdquo;
(<i>ib.</i> p. 102). The fair-haired New Zealand fairies are, too, a
kindly happy race. See Grey&rsquo;s <i>Polynesian Mythology</i>, pp. 287
to 295. Nothing is said about their dancing, but they are described
as &ldquo;merry, cheerful, and always singing like a cricket&rdquo;
(<i>ib.</i> p. 295), and from one of their fishing-nets left on the sea
shore, when its fairy owners were surprised by the rising of the
sun, the Maoris learnt the stitch for netting a net. Like the
Indian fairies they appear to be as big as human beings.</p>

<p>7. Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute; is drowned in a tank and becomes a flower;
she is killed and brought to life several times: compare in this
collection the story of the &ldquo;Pomegranate Children&rdquo; and note
to that story. In one of Ralston&rsquo;s <i>Russian Folk-Tales</i>, &ldquo;The
Fiend,&rdquo; p. 15, the heroine is killed through witchcraft: from her
grave springs a flower which is herself transformed: she afterwards
regains her human shape.</p>

<p>8. With Ph&uacute;lmati&rsquo;s last transformation compare the last that
the B&eacute;l-Princess goes through (p. <a href="#Page_148">148</a> of this collection), and
that of a woman, who figures in a Din&aacute;jpur story published by
Mr. G.&nbsp;H. Damant in the <i>Indian Antiquary</i> of April 5th, 1872,
vol. I. p. 115. She, though living in the Rakshas country, is
not a Rakshas, but does not appear to be an ordinary mortal,
and when cut to bits by a certain magic knife becomes a tree.
&ldquo;Her feet became a silver stem, her two hands golden branches,
her head ornaments were diamond leaves, all her bracelets and
bangles were pearly fruits, and her head was a peacock dancing
and playing in the branches.&rdquo; As soon as the magic knife is
thrown to the ground she regains her human form.</p>

<p>Eisenlaci in Stier&rsquo;s <i>Ungarische Sagen und Maerchen</i> (pp.
107-109) comes in the form of a horse to the twelve-headed
dragon&rsquo;s house. He is killed; the first two drops of his blood
are thrown into the garden and from them springs a tree with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
golden apples: the tree is cut down, but the first two chips
(which are flung into the pond) become a gold fish: the gold
fish turns into Eisenlaci himself in human form.</p>

<p>9. Winning a wife by seizing her dress while she bathes is an
incident common to fairy tales of many countries.</p>


<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nii" id="nii"></a>II.&mdash;THE POMEGRANATE KING.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sii">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. Such is the story as told by Dunkn&iacute; in 1876; at that time,
when it was read over to her, she said it was correct. On my
asking her in 1878, when the story was going through the press,
to explain some points in it, such as why the children said they
had been brought to life <em>three</em> times, the boy having only died
twice, and the girl once, she told me the following variation:
After the attempt to get rid of the boy by making him into a
curry had failed, the R&aacute;n&iacute; Sunk&aacute;s&iacute; sent for a sepoy and bade
him carry the two children to the jungle and there kill them;
and as a proof of their death he was to bring her their livers.
Once in the jungle with the children, the sepoy had not the
heart to kill them; so he left them in it, and brought the livers
of two goats to Sunk&aacute;s&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;. She buried the livers in the
garden and was content; but some months later as she was
walking (literally &ldquo;eating the air&rdquo;) in the jungle she saw her
step-children playing about; she returned to the palace, sent
for the sepoy, and asked him why he had not killed the children.
&ldquo;I did kill them,&rdquo; said the sepoy, &ldquo;and brought you their
livers.&rdquo; &ldquo;Those livers were not the children&rsquo;s livers,&rdquo; answered
the R&aacute;n&iacute;; &ldquo;I have just seen the children alive and playing in
the jungle.&rdquo; &ldquo;They must have been other people&rsquo;s children
that you saw,&rdquo; said the sepoy, &ldquo;yours I killed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not tell
me lies,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;n&iacute;. &ldquo;Now you must at once go to the
jungle, kill the children, and bring me their eyes.&rdquo; The sepoy
went to find the children, but when he found them he could not
kill them, so he took them to some people who lived in a hut,
and said to these people, &ldquo;Take great care of the two children.
Be very kind to them.&rdquo; He then killed two goats and took their
eyes to the R&aacute;n&iacute;, who was now satisfied for some time. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
one day another of the Pomegranate R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s sepoys passed near
the hut, and saw the children playing about. So he went to
Sunk&aacute;s&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; and told her the children were alive and well. At
this the R&aacute;n&iacute; was very angry, and she thought, &ldquo;It is of no use
my sending the first sepoy again to kill them. I will send this
man.&rdquo; She said, therefore, to the second sepoy, &ldquo;If you will
kill these children for me, you shall have a great reward.&rdquo; The
sepoy agreed, went to the little hut, and seized the children.
The poor people who took care of the children begged and
prayed him to have pity on them; but the sepoy said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
He had the R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s orders to kill them, and they must and should
be killed. And so he killed them and brought their livers to the
R&aacute;n&iacute; as she had bidden him. Sunk&aacute;s&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; was very happy
when she saw the livers, and she buried them close to a large
tank that was in her garden.</p>

<p>Some three months later her servants came to her and told her
a beautiful large b&eacute;l-fruit was floating on the water of the tank.
Sunk&aacute;s&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; went at once with them to the tank, and when she
saw the fruit she was seized with a great longing to have it. So
she sent all her servants, one after the other, into the tank to
fetch it; but all to no purpose, for as soon as any one of them
got close to the fruit it floated away from him. Then the R&aacute;n&iacute;
herself went into the tank. She, however, was not a whit more
able to get it: when she thought she had only to put out her
hand to take it, the fruit rose up into the air, and fell into the
water again as soon as she had come up out of the tank. She
went to the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; and told him of this lovely b&eacute;l-fruit, and
then went to her room while he came down to the tank. He said,
&ldquo;I should like to catch the fruit: I wonder if I can do so.
What a lovely fruit!&rdquo; As soon as he put his hand into the
water the fruit came floating towards him, and floated into it.
&ldquo;I think this fruit is quite ripe,&rdquo; said the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;. &ldquo;Quite
ripe,&rdquo; said the servants, and they struck it with a stone to break
it open. &ldquo;Oh, you hurt us! you hurt us!&rdquo; cried little voices
from inside the b&eacute;l-fruit. &ldquo;Gently, gently; don&rsquo;t hurt us.&rdquo; The
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; and all the servants were greatly surprised, and the
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; went to Sunk&aacute;s&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;, and told her all about the little
voices. She at once guessed her step-children were in the fruit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
so she said to the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;, &ldquo;You had better take the fruit to
the jungle and there break it open with a big stone, so that anything
inside it may be crushed to bits.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will not do that,&rdquo;
said the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;. Then he went back to his servants and
made them cut the fruit&rsquo;s rind very carefully cross-ways and
the fruit broke into halves: in one half sat his little son, in
the other his little daughter. As soon as the halves were laid
on the ground the children stepped out, and at once grew to
their natural size. Their father was very angry when he saw
them. &ldquo;Why, I thought you were at school,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute; told me you were at school. Why are you not there?
What funny (Dunkn&iacute;&rsquo;s own word) children you are to get into
this b&eacute;l-fruit! What made you like to live in a fruit?&rdquo; But to
all his questionings and scoldings the children said not one word.
At last he sent them up to the palace, and there they stayed
with him for some three months. But the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute; said to
him, &ldquo;These are not your children. Yours are at school.&rdquo;
&ldquo;They <em>are</em> my children,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>All this time the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute; hated them more and more, and
at last she went to them and said, &ldquo;Now I really will kill you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Just as you please,&rdquo; answered the children; &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t mind
being killed. You may kill us three times, four times, as often
as you like: it does not matter in the least; for God will always
bring us to life again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Sunk&aacute;s&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; flew into a rage and she called her servants
and said, &ldquo;Kill these children, cut them into mince-meat
and throw them to the crows and kites. When the crows and
kites have eaten them, they cannot come to life any more.&rdquo; So
the servants killed the children, and chopped them up very fine
and fed the crows and kites with their flesh; and now the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute;
was very happy.</p>

<p>Some months later, as she was walking in her garden, she
saw two beautiful flower-buds on a large b&eacute;l-tree that grew in it.
She showed them to the gardener, and asked if he had seen
them before. &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;On this tree there
have never been either flowers or fruit till now.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gather the
flowers for me,&rdquo; said the R&aacute;n&iacute;, &ldquo;I do so wish to have them.&rdquo;
The gardener said to her, &ldquo;Wait till the buds are fully blown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
and then I will gather them for you.&rdquo; At the end of three or
four days the R&aacute;n&iacute; Sunk&aacute;s&iacute; asked if the buds had grown into
large flowers, and the gardener said, &ldquo;Yes, to-day I will gather
them for you.&rdquo; He got a long, long bamboo cane, and tied a
piece of wood cross-ways on one of its ends so as to make a sort
of hook wherewith to catch hold of and break off the flowers.
He tried and tried to get them, but all in vain. Then he made
all the servants try. It was of no use, no one could make the
hook touch the flowers. They always bent themselves just out
of its reach. Then Sunk&aacute;s&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; tried, but with no better success.
She told the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;, who said, &ldquo;I will try to-morrow to
gather these wonderful flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night as the R&aacute;n&iacute; lay in her bed she suddenly thought,
&ldquo;Those children are in the flowers,&rdquo; and she determined to be
with her husband when he gathered them, to get them into her
own hands some way or other.</p>

<p>The next morning An&aacute;rb&aacute;s&aacute; Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; and his wife went to
the b&eacute;l-tree, and as soon as he held out his hand towards the
flowers, they dropped into it. &ldquo;What lovely flowers! What
beautiful flowers! Do give them to me,&rdquo; said Sunk&aacute;s&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;, &ldquo;I will keep them myself.&rdquo; Then he
carried them to his room and laid them on the table while he
shut the door and the venetians. Then he came and sat down
before them: he took them in his hand, and looked at them
and laid them again on the table; then he took them and smelt
them, and they smelt, oh! so sweet. This he did many times.
At last he held them to his ears, for the adventure of the b&eacute;l-fruit
had made him wise (<i>hushy&aacute;r</i>), and he heard little tiny voices,
saying, &ldquo;Papa&rdquo; (Dunkn&iacute;&rsquo;s own word), &ldquo;we want to stay with
you; we should like to be with you.&rdquo; The Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; looked
very carefully at the flowers, and at last, in one of them he saw
a little splinter of wood like a thorn sticking: he pulled this out,
and his own little son stood before him. Then he looked at the
other flower, and in that, too, was a little splinter of wood sticking.
When he pulled it out his little girl stood there.</p>

<p>The Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; was vexed with his children, and asked them
why they were so naughty, and why they liked to live in fruits
and flowers instead of staying in the palace or going to school.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
The children answered, &ldquo;We go to school sometimes, and then
we come back and live in our flowers, and then we return to
school, and then we come back to our flower-homes again.&rdquo;
&ldquo;This is a lie you are telling me,&rdquo; said their father. &ldquo;You
know quite well you have not been at school at all.&rdquo; The
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute; came in to hear what all this talking meant, and when
she saw the children she said to An&aacute;rb&aacute;s&aacute; Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;, &ldquo;These
are not your children, yours are at school.&rdquo; &ldquo;They are my
children,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and they have never been at school at
all, and they are very naughty.&rdquo; He then sent them away to
play, and the R&aacute;n&iacute; returned to her room. But he sat alone in
his room, for he was angry and cross. As he sat there one of
his chapr&aacute;s&iacute;s came to him and said, &ldquo;Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j, you do not
know how ill the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;n&iacute; treats your children, or you would
not be angry with them. She has killed them several times,
and sent them away into the jungle; and after they came out
of the b&eacute;l-fruit she killed them and chopped them into small
pieces, and fed the kites and crows with their flesh.&rdquo; When the
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; heard all this, he said to the chapr&aacute;s&iacute;, &ldquo;You must
have a beautiful little house built for me; you must take care
that it is chiefly made of wood; the flooring must be very thin
and of wood; and the hollow place under the flooring must be
filled with dry wood. Then you must put plenty of flowers
inside the house, and plenty outside so as to make it very
pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as the house was ready the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; went to his
wife and asked her if she would go out with him to eat the air.
&ldquo;I should like to show you a new house I have had built for
you,&rdquo; he said. So she went with him and thought her new
house lovely. While she was inside looking at the pretty
flowers in the rooms, the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; slipped out, and bolted the
door so that she could not escape, and he told his servants to
set fire to the wood under the flooring. When the flames began
to rise the R&aacute;n&iacute; got very frightened. She rushed to the window
and called to the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; and his servants, who were
standing there looking on, to save her. No one said anything
to her. &ldquo;Save me,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;or I shall be burnt to death.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If you are burnt, what does it matter?&rdquo; said the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute;.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
&ldquo;You ill-treated my children; you killed them; so, now
burn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as she was burnt to death the Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; had all her
bones collected and put into four dishes, and he gave them to
one of his servants to take to Sunk&aacute;s&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute;&rsquo;s mother. When
her mother uncovered dish after dish and found nothing but
bones, she asked the servant, &ldquo;Of what use are bones?&rdquo; &ldquo;These
are your daughter&rsquo;s bones,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;therefore An&aacute;rb&aacute;s&aacute;
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;j&aacute; sent them to you. Sunk&aacute;s&iacute; R&aacute;n&iacute; ill-treated and killed
his children, and so he burnt her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rest of the story she pronounced exact (<i>th&iacute;k</i>).</p>

compare in this book: Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute;, pp. <a href="#Page_3">3</a> and <a href="#Page_4">4</a>: the
Kite&rsquo;s Children, p. <a href="#Page_22">22</a>: the B&eacute;l-Princess, pp. <a href="#Page_144">144</a>, <a href="#Page_145">145</a>, <a href="#Page_148">148</a>: and
in <i>Old Deccan Days</i> Surya Bai, pp. 85, 86. In &ldquo;Die goldenen
Kinder&rdquo; (Schott&rsquo;s <i>Wallachische Maerchen</i>) the golden children
are killed and buried (p. 122). From their hearts spring two
apple-trees having golden leaves and apples. The trees are destroyed;
but a sheep has eaten an apple and then has two golden
lambs. The step-mother kills them at once and sends the maid
to wash the entrails in the stream, intending to cook them for
her husband to eat (compare the curry in the &ldquo;Pomegranate
King,&rdquo; p. <a href="#Page_8">8</a>; the broth (<i>Suhr</i>) in Grimm&rsquo;s &ldquo;von dem Machandelboom,&rdquo;
<i>Kinder und Hausmaerchen</i>, vol. I. p. 271; and the stew
in the Devonshire story, &ldquo;The Rose-Tree,&rdquo; told in Henderson&rsquo;s
<i>Folk-lore of the Northern Counties of England</i>, p. 314). A piece
of the entrail escapes, and as it floats away it swells and swells.
On reaching the opposite bank it bursts, and out of it step the
golden children. In a Hungarian story the children, one with
a planet and one with a sun on his forehead, and each with a
ring on his arm, are killed by a wicked woman who wants her
daughter to take their mother&rsquo;s place as queen. They turn first
into two golden pear-trees. These are destroyed by fire, but
one glowing coal from the fire is eaten by an old she-goat. The
old goat then has two little golden-fleeced kids. They are
killed, an old crow swallows a piece of the entrails as they are
being washed in the brook; she flies to the seventy-seventh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
island in the ocean, builds a nest and lays two golden eggs. Out
of the eggs come the golden-haired children with their planet,
sun and golden rings. The old crow sends them for seven years
to school to a hermit (here is the holy man again, see p. <a href="#Page_283">283</a> of
these notes), and then flies home with them to their father. The
pillar of salt, into which their mother was changed, answers all
the king&rsquo;s questions. It is not said that she regained her human
form (&ldquo;Die verwandelten Kinder,&rdquo; Stier&rsquo;s <i>Ungarische Volksmaerchen</i>,
p. 58). In a Siebenburg story, &ldquo;Die beiden goldenen
Kinder,&rdquo; the children are killed by an envious woman who becomes
queen in their mother&rsquo;s place. From their remains
spring two golden pine-trees which are burnt; a sheep eats two
of the sparks and has two golden lambs that are killed; from
two pieces of the entrails step forth the golden-haired children
(Haltrich&rsquo;s <i>Siebenbuergische Maerchen</i>, pp. 2, 3). In this tale
the children are restored to their father, the king, by the intervention
of God himself (p. 4), who in these <i>Siebenbuergische
Maerchen</i> plays a part just as often as &ldquo;Khud&aacute;&rdquo; does in the
Indian tales, taking for the purpose the form of a &ldquo;good old
man,&rdquo; and often wearing a grey mantle that reminds one of
Odin. In the Netherlandish story of &ldquo;The knight with the
swan&rdquo; (Thorpe&rsquo;s <i>Northern Mythology</i>, vol. III. p. 302), King
Oriant&rsquo;s mother persuades the king his wife gave him seven
puppies instead of seven children (each born with a silver chain
round its neck in &ldquo;proof of their mother&rsquo;s nobility&rdquo;). She sends
the children to the forest to be destroyed. They are left there
alive, and are fostered by an old man. When the queen-mother
learns this, she sends servants to kill them. These are
content with depriving six of the children of their silver chains,
on which the children instantly become swans. (The seventh
child is absent and so is saved.) A goldsmith makes two beakers
out of one of the chains, and keeps the others intact. When
the chains are hung again round the five swans&rsquo; necks, and the
beaker shown to the sixth, they regain their human forms. See
also paragraph 8 of the notes to Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute;.</p>

R&aacute;n&iacute; and her two maids,&rdquo; p. 95. With these may be compared
the Polish Madey (Naake&rsquo;s <i>Slavonic Fairy Tales</i>, p. 220).
Madey is a robber who commits fearful crimes; he repents,
and sticks his &ldquo;murderous club&rdquo; upright in the ground, swearing
to kneel before it till the boy who has caused his repentance
returns as a bishop. Years go by: the boy, now a bishop,
passes through Madey&rsquo;s forest. The club has become an apple-tree
full of apples and he discovers Madey through their sweet
odour. At Madey&rsquo;s request the bishop confesses him; and as
Madey confesses his crimes, the apples on the tree, one after
another, become white doves and fly to heaven. They were the
souls of those he had murdered.</p>

<p>In an unpublished story told by Dunkn&iacute;, the incidents of the
children being in the fruit, and the fruit not letting itself be
gathered by any but the rightful owner of its contents (as is the
case also with the B&eacute;l-Princess), again occur. In this story
there is a prince called Aisab, who, as he wished very much to
have children, married. At the same time he took an oath that
if his child, when he had one, cried, he would kill it, and then
if his wife cried he would kill her too. His first wife gave him
a child who died; she cried and was killed by her husband.
The same thing happened to the second wife. He then married
a third wife, called Gul&iacute;an&aacute;r. She had a little son, D&iacute;m&aacute;-ahmad,
and two or three years later another son, called Kar&aacute;mat.
The first boy died, but Gul&iacute;an&aacute;r did not cry&mdash;she only
grieved for him in her heart. Kar&aacute;mat was unhappy from seeing
other children playing with their brothers and sisters, and
asked his mother &ldquo;why he had no brother or sister to play with?&rdquo;
She said, &ldquo;Once you had a little brother and he died.&rdquo; Then
Kar&aacute;mat began to cry, and his father killed him immediately with
his sword because of his oath, though he loved Kar&aacute;mat dearly.
The &ldquo;mother was still sadder than before, but she never wept.&rdquo;
Then God took pity on her and sent down into Prince Aisab&rsquo;s
garden a big b&eacute;l-tree, and on this b&eacute;l-tree was a fruit. Every one
tried to gather this fruit, even Prince Aisab tried, but each time
their hands approached it the fruit rose into the air and returned
again when the hands were withdrawn. Then Gul&iacute;an&aacute;r stretched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
out her hand &ldquo;and the fruit fell into it.&rdquo; She took it into the
house and tried to break it open with a stone, and a voice called
out, &ldquo;Mother, mother, not so hard; you hurt us.&rdquo; She was
very much frightened, thinking a Rakshas or a demon was in
the fruit. Prince Aisab was equally alarmed, but his waz&iacute;r,
Mamatsa, broke the fruit open gently in obedience to the little
voice that called out, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t knock so hard, Mamatsa; you
hurt us;&rdquo; and out of it stepped the two little children D&iacute;m&aacute;-ahmad
and Kar&aacute;mat. D&iacute;m&aacute;-ahmad was very beautiful. On
his head was the sun, on his face the moon, and on his hands
stars, and he had long golden hair. He married a princess,
At&aacute;sa, who also had the sun on her head, the moon on her face,
stars on her hands, and &ldquo;her hair was of pure gold and reached
down to the ground.&rdquo; The idea that none but the rightful owner
can catch the child is found too in Grey&rsquo;s <i>Polynesian Mythology</i>
at pp. 116, 117, in the story of Whakatau, who was fashioned in
the sea from his mother Apakura&rsquo;s apron by the god Rongota-kawiu.
This child lived at the bottom of the sea; but one day
he came on shore after his kite, and all who saw him tried in
vain to catch him. Then said Whakatau, &ldquo;You had better go
and bring Apakura here; she is the only person who can catch
me and hold me fast.&rdquo; His mother then comes and catches him.</p>

<p>5. Sunk&aacute;s&iacute;&rsquo;s bones are sent to her mother. In the <i>Sicilianische
Maerchen</i> collected by Laura Gonzenbach, it is a
common practice for husbands to punish their second wives&rsquo;
treachery with death, and then to send their remains to their
mothers, who feast on them, thinking they are eating tunny-fish,
and die of grief on learning what they have really
swallowed.</p>

<p>6. With Gul&iacute;an&aacute;r&rsquo;s change into a bird compare Laura Gonzenbach&rsquo;s
13th <i>Sicilianische Maerchen</i>, vol. I. p. 82, where the
real bride is transformed into a dove by a black-headed pin
being driven into her head, and regains her human form when
the pin is pulled out. Schott has a similar incident in his <i>Wallachische
Maerchen</i>, p. 251. So has Gubernatis (<i>Zoological Mythology</i>,
vol. II. p. 242) in a story from near Leghorn, where
the woman is changed into a swallow (in all these stories it is
the husband who pulls out the pin); and he says similar stories
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
with a transformation into a dove are told in Piedmont, in other
parts of Tuscany, in Calabria, and are to be found in the <i>Tutiname</i>.
Ralston&rsquo;s Princess Mariya (<i>Russian Folk Tales</i>, p. 183),
and Thorpe&rsquo;s second story of &ldquo;The Princess that came out of
the water&rdquo; (<i>Yule Tide Stories</i>, p. 41), may also be compared.</p>

<p>7. The golden bird in the Siebenburg story drops pearls from
its beak whenever it sings (&ldquo;Der goldne Vogel,&rdquo; Haltrich&rsquo;s
<i>Siebenbuergische Maerchen</i>, pp. 31, 35). The princess, its mistress,
wears (p. 39) a golden mantle &ldquo;adorned with <em>carbuncles</em>
and pearls from the golden bird.&rdquo;</p>

then tries to break his promise. Compare &ldquo;The Brahman, the
Tiger, and the six Judges,&rdquo; <i>Old Deccan Days</i>, p. 159; and
&ldquo;Ananzi and the Lion&rdquo; in Dasent&rsquo;s <i>Ananzi Stories</i>, p. 490.</p>

<p>2. In a Slavonic story mentioned by Gubernatis (<i>Zoological
Mythology</i>, vol. II. p. 111), a bear is about to kill a peasant in revenge.
A fox appears, &ldquo;shakes its tail and says to the peasant,
&lsquo;Man, thou hast ingenuity in thy head and a stick in thy
hand.&rsquo; The peasant immediately understands the stratagem,&rdquo;
and persuades the bear to get into a sack he has with him that
he may carry the bear three times round the field instead of
doing penance, after which the bear is to do what he likes with
him. The bear gets into the sack, the man &ldquo;binds it strongly&rdquo;
together, and then beats the bear to death with his stick.
Gubernatis at p. 132 of the same volume tells a similar story
from Russia in which a wolf plays the part of the bear and of
our tiger.</p>


<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="niv" id="niv"></a>IV.&mdash;THE CAT THAT COULD NOT BE KILLED.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#siv">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. In an unpublished story told us by Gangiy&aacute;, a hill-man
from near Simla, a cat saves herself from being eaten by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
jackal very much in the same way that this cat saved herself
from the leopard. The jackal (in Gangiy&aacute;&rsquo;s story) ate anything
it came across, whether it were dead or alive. One day he met
a tiger and said to him, &ldquo;I will eat you. I will not let you go.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the tiger, &ldquo;eat me.&rdquo; So the jackal ate him
up. He went a little further and met a leopard; he said to the
leopard, &ldquo;I will eat you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the leopard.
So he ate the leopard. He went a little further and met a tiny
mouse. &ldquo;Mouse,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have eaten a tiger and a leopard,
and now I will eat you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the mouse. He
ate the mouse. He went a little further and met a cat. &ldquo;I will
eat you,&rdquo; said the jackal. The cat answered, &ldquo;What will it
profit you to eat me, who am so small? A little further on you
will see a dead buffalo: eat that.&rdquo; So the jackal left the cat and
went to eat the buffalo. He walked on and on, but could find
no buffalo; and the cat, meanwhile ran away. The jackal was
very angry, and set off to seek the cat, but could not find her.
He was furious.</p>


<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nvi" id="nvi"></a>VI.&mdash;THE RAT AND THE FROG.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#svi">To&nbsp;story</a></span>Compare the Bohemian &ldquo;Long-desired child,&rdquo; Naake&rsquo;s
<i>Slavonic Fairy Tales</i>, p. 226. This child is carved out of a
tree-root by a woodman, who brings him home to his wife. They
delight in having a child at last. The child eats all the food in
the house; his father and mother; a girl with a wheelbarrow
full of clover; a peasant, his hay-laden cart, and his cart-horses;
a man and his pigs; a shepherd, his flock and dog; lastly, cabbages
belonging to an old woman who cuts him in two with her
mattock just as he tries to eat her. Out of him jump unhurt
every thing and every one he has swallowed. In a story from
the south of Siberia (Gubernatis&rsquo; <i>Zoological Mythology</i>, vol. I.
p. 140) the hero vanquishes a demon, who tells him that in his
stomach he will find a silver casket. He cuts the monster open
and out of him come &ldquo;innumerable animals, men, treasures, and
other objects. Some of the men say, &lsquo;What noble youth has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
delivered us from the black night?&rsquo;&rdquo; In two of the caskets the
hero finds the eyes of an old woman who has befriended him,
and money, &ldquo;and from the last casket came forth more men,
animals, and valuables of every kind.&rdquo; In a Russian story
quoted by Gubernatis (<i>Zoological Mythology</i>, vol. I. pp. 406,
407) the wolf eats the kids all but one. The mother goat persuades
him to jump over a fire. The fire splits his belly open,
out tumble all the little kids, lively as ever. There is a very
similar story with fox, goat, and kid for actors in Campbell&rsquo;s
<i>Popular Tales of the West Highlands</i>, vol. III. p. 93; and
Grimm has one also, &ldquo;Der Wolf und die sieben jungen Geislein,&rdquo;
in his <i>Kinder und Hausmaerchen</i>, vol. I. p. 29. In the
notes to this story, vol. III. p. 15, Grimm says, &ldquo;In Pomerania
this is told of a child who when his mother had gone out was
swallowed by the child-spectre, resembling the varlet Ruprecht.
But the stones which he swallows with the child make the spectre
so heavy that he falls to the earth, and the child unhurt springs
out of him.&rdquo; See, too, the demons at p. <a href="#Page_99">99</a> of these stories, who
swallow the Princess Champ&aacute;k&aacute;l&iacute;&rsquo;s suitors.</p>


<p class="hrpad">Tylor in his <i>Primitive Culture</i>, vol. I. p. 341, classes Little
Red Riding Hood among these Day and Night myths. It is, he
says, &ldquo;mutilated in the English Nursery version, but known
more perfectly by old wives in Germany, who can tell that the
lovely little maid in her shining red satin cloak was swallowed
with her grandmother by the wolf, but they both came out safe
and sound when the hunter cut open the sleeping beast.&rdquo; He
also quotes among these myths (<i>ib.</i> p. 338) a story of the Ojibwas
in which the hero is swallowed by a great fish and cut out
again by his sister; and another belonging to the Basutos in
which all mankind save the hero and his mother were devoured
by a monster. The hero &ldquo;attacked the creature and was
swallowed whole, but cutting his way out he set free all the inhabitants
of the world.&rdquo; At the same page is the story of the
Zulu Princess Untombinde who was carried off by a dreadful
beast. &ldquo;The king gathered his army and attacked it, but it
swallowed up men, and dogs, and cattle, all but one warrior;
he slew the monster, and there came out cattle, and horses, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
men, and last of all the princess herself.&rdquo; Mr. Tylor quotes, too
(<i>ib.</i> p. 336), in connexion with this class of myths, the story of
the death of the New Zealand sun-hero, Maui, which he tells
more fully than does Sir George Grey in his <i>Polynesian Mythology</i>;
and he goes on at pp. 338, 339, 340, to connect these myths
with those of Perseus and Andromeda; Heracles and Hesione;
the story of Jonah and his fish; the Greenland angakok
swallowed by bear and walrus and thrown up again; and the
legend of Hades.</p>

<p>Besides the angakok mentioned by Mr. Tylor, Dr. Rink, in his
<i>Tales and Traditions of the Eskimo</i>, has two other stories of
escapes from the stomach of a dead animal when it is cut open.
In the first, at p. 260, the boy is devoured by a gull; his sister
kills the bird, takes her brother&rsquo;s bones from its pouch and
carries them home: on the way the boy comes to life again.
The other tale, p. 438, tells how Nakasungnak jumped out of the
hole his friends had made in the dead &ldquo;ice-covered&rdquo; bear&rsquo;s side;
but his hair as well as the skin of his face had come off, and he
shivered from cold and ague. And in Ralston&rsquo;s <i>Songs of the
Russian People</i>, p. 177, is a story of a snake who steals &ldquo;the
luminaries of the night. A hero cuts off his head, and out
of the slain monster issue the Bright Moon and the Morning
Star.&rdquo;</p>

(Gonzenbach&rsquo;s <i>Sicilianische Maerchen</i>, vol. I. p. 249). In
England he appears in an out-of-the-way village in the south
(see <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, July 12, 1878, p. 11, <i>Wild Life in a
Southern Country</i>, No. XIV.) with, to use his mother&rsquo;s words,
&ldquo;no more sense than God had given him.&rdquo; She wishing to
have his testimony discredited when he bears witness against
her, as she knows he will, goes upstairs and rains raisins on

him from the window. So when asked to specify the time he
speaks of, he says, &ldquo;When it rained raisins,&rdquo; and is of course
disbelieved.</p>

<p>Note by Mr. J.&nbsp;F. Campbell: &ldquo;This story of a stupid boy

though he told the truth.&rdquo; [At p. 385, vol. II. of the <i>Tales of

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sviii">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. Forbes in his Hind&uacute;st&aacute;n&iacute; Dictionary says <i>Kans</i> or <i>Kansa</i>
was the name of a wicked tyrant whom Krish&#7751;a was born to
destroy, and that the word now means a wicked tyrant. But
R&aacute;j&aacute; K&aacute;ns is an historical character. All that is known of him
is told by the late Professor Blochmann in the Bengal Asiatic
Society&rsquo;s Journal for 1873, Pt. I. p. 264.</p>

<p>2. In the note (p. 380) to the XIXth Tale in the <i>Sagas from
the Far East</i>, is a story in which Barber H&iacute;m&rsquo;s part is played
by a he-goat, and that of his tigers by a lion. See, too, &ldquo;How
the three clever men outwitted the demons&rdquo; in <i>Old Deccan
Days</i>, pp. 273-278. In a Sant&aacute;l&iacute; tale, &ldquo;Kanran and Guja,&rdquo;
sent by the Rev. F.&nbsp;T. Cole to the <i>Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. IV.
September 1875, p. 257, two brothers, Kanran and Guja, climb
into a t&aacute;l tree. Here they are discovered by a tiger whom
they have deprived of his tail, and who has brought a number
of his friends to help him revenge himself on the brothers. The
tailless tiger proposes they shall all stand one the top of the
other, to reach the men in the tree. His friends agree provided
he takes his stand at the bottom, and they climb as proposed
till they almost reach the brothers. Then Kanran calls out to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>259]</a></span>
Guja, &ldquo;Give me your axe. I will kill the tailless tiger.&rdquo; The
tigers in terror all tumble to the ground, crushing their tailless
friend in their fall, and flee to their homes. In &ldquo;The Leopard
and the Ram&rdquo; (Bleek&rsquo;s <i>Hottentot Fables and Tales</i>, p. 24) the
ram and the leopard play the parts of the barber and his tigers.

<p>2. Rakshas means protector, and is, probably, an euphemistic
term. The chapter on Mystic Animals in Swedish traditions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
(Thorpe&rsquo;s <i>Northern Mythology</i>, vol. II. p. 83) gives a list
of certain creatures that are not to be mentioned by their
own but by euphemistic names for fear of incurring their wrath.
This belief, Thorpe in the same chapter, p. 84, says, extends
to certain inanimate things: water used for brewing, for instance,
must not be called <i>vatn</i> (water) or the beer will not be
so good; and fire occasionally is to be spoken of as <i>hetta</i> (heat).
The girl in an Esthonian tale quoted by Gubernatis at p. 151 of
the 1st vol. of his <i>Zoological Mythology</i> addresses a crow whose
help she needs as &ldquo;Bird of light.&rdquo; Fiske says (<i>Myths and
Mythmakers</i>, p. 223), &ldquo;A Dayak will not allude by name to
the small-pox, but will call it &lsquo;The chief&rsquo; or &lsquo;Jungle leaves;&rsquo;
the Laplander speaks of the bear as &lsquo;the old man with the
fur coat;&rsquo; in Annam the tiger is called &lsquo;Grandfather,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Lord.&rsquo; The Finnish hunters called the bear &lsquo;the Apple of
the Forest, the beautiful Honey-claw, the Pride of the thicket&rsquo;&rdquo;
(&ldquo;The Mythology of Finnland,&rdquo; <i>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, May 1857).
The Furies, as every one knows, were called the Eumenides, or
the gracious ones.</p>

<p>The Rakshases are a kind of huge demons who delight in
devouring men and beasts. They can take any shape they
please. The female Rakshas often assumes that of a beautiful
woman. Compare the demon Mara as described by Fiske at
p. 93 of his book above quoted.</p>

<p>The Rakshases do not travel in the way mortals do. See a
Din&aacute;jpur story told by Mr. G.&nbsp;H. Damant in the <i>Indian
Antiquary</i> (February 1875, vol. IV. p. 54), where the hero,
who has married both the Rakshas-king&rsquo;s daughter and
his niece, asks his father-in-law&rsquo;s leave to return home with
his Rakshas-wives. The King consents (p. 58), but says,
&ldquo;We Rakshases do not travel in p&aacute;lk&iacute;s (palanquins), but in
the air.&rdquo; Accordingly the prince, his two Rakshas wives
and his mortal wife, all travel towards his father&rsquo;s country
through the air &ldquo;along the sky.&rdquo; One kind of jinn travel
in the same way (Lane&rsquo;s <i>Arabian Nights</i>, vol. I., &ldquo;Notes
to Introduction,&rdquo; p. 29). So do the drakes and kobolds in
Northern Germany. The drake is as big as a cauldron, &ldquo;a
person may sit in him,&rdquo; and travel with him to any spot he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>261]</a></span>
pleases. Both drakes and kobolds look like fiery stripes. The
kobolds appear sometimes as a blue, sometimes as a red, stripe
passing through the air (Thorpe&rsquo;s <i>Northern Mythology</i>, vol. III.
pp. 155, 156).</p>

<p>3. Dunkn&iacute; says, &ldquo;All Rakshases keep their souls in birds.&rdquo;
Those that do so resemble in this respect some of the Indian
demons, and the giants, trolls, and such like noxious actors in
the Norse, Scotch, and other popular tales.</p>

<p>Tylor (<i>Primitive Culture</i>, vol. II. pp. 152, 153) mentions the
Tatar story of the giant who could not be killed till the twelve-headed
snake in which he kept his soul was destroyed. This
tale, he says, &ldquo;illustrates the idea of soul-embodiment,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;very likely&rdquo; indicates the sense of the myths where giants, &amp;c.,
keep their souls out of their own bodies. The civilized notion
of soul-embodiment, he adds (quoting from &ldquo;Grose&rsquo;s bantering
description of the art of laying ghosts in the last century,&rdquo;)
is that of conjuring ghosts into different objects: &ldquo;one of the
many good instances of articles of savage belief serving as jests
among civilized men.&rdquo; Possibly these giants, trolls, rakshases,
demons, once belonged to that class of spirits who could, in
popular belief, enter at pleasure into stocks and stones and
other objects of idolatrous veneration.</p>

<p>But all Rakshases do not keep their souls in birds. Some
have their souls in bees (see a Din&aacute;jpur tale published by
Mr. G.&nbsp;H. Damant in the <i>Indian Antiquary</i> for April 6, 1872,
p. 115): and in another Din&aacute;jpur story printed by Mr. Damant
in the <i>Indian Antiquary</i> for June 7, 1872, p. 120, a whole tribe
of Rakshases dwelling in Ceylon kept theirs in one and the
same lemon.</p>

<p>4. In the first quoted of these stories collected by Mr.
Damant, that where the Rakshases keep their life in bees, the
hero is a prince who starts in search of the wonderful tree mentioned
in paragraph 8 of the note to Ph&uacute;lmati R&aacute;n&iacute; (p. <a href="#Page_244">244</a>).
In his wanderings he finds himself in the Rakshas country.
There he meets with the woman who when cut up turns into the
tree he seeks. When he first sees her she lies dead on a bed
with a golden wand on one side of her, and a silver wand on the
other. He accidentally touches her with the golden wand and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
she wakes. She tells him the Rakshases, every morning when
they go out in search of food, make her dead by touching her
with the silver wand, and wake her with the golden wand when
they return at night. Mr. Damant has another story in the
<i>Indian Antiquary</i> (July 5, 1872, vol. I. p. 219), from Din&aacute;jpur,
in which there is a prince Dalim who dies and is laid in a
tomb above ground, not buried. Daily the Apsarases, the
dancing-girls in the court of Indra, wake him from death by
touching his face with a golden wand, and make him dead
again by touching him with a silver wand. These wands they
always leave lying beside him. His wife comes one day to
mourn over him and accidentally discovers the secret of bringing
him to life. He is, finally, restored to her by the Apsarases.</p>

<p>5. According to Gubernatis, &ldquo;three and seven are sacred
numbers in Aryan faith&rdquo; (<i>Zoological Mythology</i>, vol. I. p. 6).</p>

<p>6. H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;lb&aacute;s&aacute; addresses the Rakshas as &ldquo;uncle.&rdquo; The two
brothers Kanran and Guja (in a Sant&aacute;l&iacute; fairy tale bearing
their name printed by the Rev. F.&nbsp;T. Cole in the <i>Indian Antiquary</i>,
September 1875, vol. IV. p. 257), address a tiger by the
same propitiatory title. The tiger in return addresses them
as nephews, and gives them the fire they want.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; and &ldquo;aunt&rdquo; are used in a propitiatory sense over a
great part of the world. Hunt at p. 6 of his introduction to the
<i>Romances and Drolls of the West of England</i> says, &ldquo;Uncle is
a term of respect, which was very commonly applied to aged
men by their juniors in Cornwall. Aunt ... was used in the
same manner when addressing aged women.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mon oncle&rdquo;
and &ldquo;ma tante&rdquo; are sometimes used in the same way in France.
Fiske in his <i>Myths and Mythmakers</i>, pp. 166, 167, tells how
the Zulu solar hero Uthlakanyana outwits a cannibal: in this
story the hero addresses the cannibal as &ldquo;uncle,&rdquo; and the
cannibal in return calls him &ldquo;child of my sister.&rdquo; Fiske, quoting
from Dr. Callaway, at p. 166, says, &ldquo;It is perfectly clear
that the cannibals of the Zulu legends are not common men;
they are magnified into giants and magicians; they are remarkably
swift and enduring; fierce and terrible warriors.&rdquo; In the
Hottentot story of the &ldquo;Lion who took a woman&rsquo;s shape,&rdquo; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
lion and the woman address each other as &ldquo;my aunt,&rdquo; and &ldquo;my
uncle&rdquo; (Bleek&rsquo;s <i>Hottentot Fables and Tales</i>, pp. 51, 52). In
Siberia the Yakuts worship the bear under the name of their
&ldquo;beloved uncle&rdquo; (Tylor&rsquo;s <i>Primitive Culture</i>, vol. II. p. 231);
and when the Russian peasant calls on the dreaded Lyeshy to
appear he cries, &ldquo;Uncle Lyeshy&rdquo; (Ralston&rsquo;s <i>Songs of the Russian
people</i>, p. 159).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grannie&rdquo; is the word used by Dunkn&iacute; herself.</p>

<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nxii" id="nxii"></a>XII.&mdash;THE MAN WHO WENT TO SEEK HIS FATE.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxii">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. Compare a Servian story, &ldquo;Das Schicksal&rdquo; (Karadschitsch,
<i>Volksmaerchen der Serben</i>, p. 106), in which a man
sets out to seek his fate, and on the road is commissioned
by a rich householder to ask the fate why, though he gives
abundance of food to his servants, he can never satisfy their
hunger, and why his aged, miserable father and mother do not
die: by another man, to ask why his cattle diminish instead
of thriving: and, thirdly, by a river whose waters bear him
safely across it, to ask why no living thing lives in it. His
fate answers all these questions, and instructs him how to thrive
himself. In Fr&auml;ulein Gonzenbach&rsquo;s <i>Sicilian Fairy Tales</i>, &ldquo;Die
Geschichte von Caterina und ihrem Schicksal,&rdquo; vol. I. p. 130,
Caterina is persecuted by her fate, who wears the form of a
lovely woman. At last she begs her mistress&rsquo;s fate, to whom
she daily carries a propitiatory offering, to intercede for her with
her own fate. She is told in answer that her own fate is wrapped
in seven veils and so cannot hear her prayer. Finally her mistress&rsquo;s
fate leads her to her own. In the same collection, in
&ldquo;Feledico und Epomata&rdquo; (vol. I. p. 350), Feledico&rsquo;s fate plays a
personal part.</p>

<p>This Indian story looks like a relic of stock and stone
worship (see Tylor&rsquo;s <i>Primitive Culture</i>, vol. II. chapters XIV.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
and XV.). Compare the man&rsquo;s beating his fate-stone with
the treatment the Ostyak gives his puppet. If it is good to
him he clothes and feeds it with broth; &ldquo;if it brings him no
sport he will try the effect of a good thrashing on it, after
which he will clothe and feed it again&rdquo; (<i>ib.</i> p. 170). Other
examples are given at the same page. These spirits and gods,
for whose dwelling-place stocks and stones and other objects
had been supplied, were not supposed always to inhabit these
abodes; but they did so at pleasure. Compare Elijah&rsquo;s address
to the priests of Baal, &ldquo;Cry aloud: for he is a god; either
he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure
he sleepeth&rdquo; (1 Kings xviii. 27), with Caterina&rsquo;s
seven-veiled fate, and the prostrate fate-stone in our story
whose spirit-owner was evidently absent on some expedition.
These fates may be compared with the patron or guardian
spirits of whom Mr. Tylor speaks at pp. 199-203 of the same
volume. He says (p. 202), &ldquo;The Egyptian astrologer warned
Antonius to keep far from the young Octavius, &lsquo;for thy demon,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;is in fear of his.&rsquo;&rdquo; If one man&rsquo;s demon or genius were
at enmity with that of another man, it would probably be
friendly to that of a third man, and would therefore be acquainted
with its secrets and with its motives of behaviour to the
man it guarded. Hence the advice given by her mistress to
Caterina to inquire of her own fate from her mistress&rsquo;s fate, and
the questions to be put to their fates when found given to the
men in the Indian and Servian stories. These questions remind
one of those entrusted to the youths in European tales as they
journey to the dragon or devil to whom they are sent for destruction.
Like the fates in the Indian and Servian stories, these
dragons and devils live at the end of a long and difficult journey.
Caterina has to climb a mountain to visit her mistress&rsquo;s fate.</p>

<p>2. Gubernatis (<i>Zoological Mythology</i>, vol. I. p. 22), speaking
of the three <i>Ribhavas</i>, says, &ldquo;During the twelve days (the twelve
hours of the night or the twelve months in the year) in which
they are the guests of Agohyas,&rdquo; &amp;c. So possibly the twelve
years in this and other stories in this collection may be the
twelve hours of the night. In an unpublished story told by
Dunkn&iacute;, &ldquo;Prince H&uacute;sains&aacute;&rsquo;s journey,&rdquo; the prince journeys for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
twelve years. When he returns home he finds his parents as
he had left them&mdash;fast asleep in bed. To them the twelve years
had only been as one night.</p>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxiii">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. The Boar is an avat&aacute;r of Vish&#7751;u.</p>

<p>2. A &#7693;om (the d is lingual) is a Hind&uacute; of a very low caste.</p>

<p>3. Possibly this king is the same as the king Harichand in
the last story but one in the collection, p. <a href="#Page_224">224</a>, and he may also
be the Hari&ccedil;chandra of the following letter from Mr. C.&nbsp;H.
Tawney:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been looking up the story of &lsquo;Hari&ccedil;chandra.&rsquo; It is
to be found in Muir, vol. I. He gives a summary of it from the
<i>Marka&#7751;&#7693;eya Pur&aacute;&#7751;a</i>. It is also found in the &lsquo;Chanda Kau&ccedil;ikam,&rsquo;
and in Mutu Coomara Swamy&rsquo;s &lsquo;Martyr of Truth.&rsquo; The following
is Muir&rsquo;s summary summarized. Hari&ccedil;chandra was a king
who lived in the Tret&aacute; age, and was renowned for his virtue, and
for the universal prosperity, moral and physical, which prevailed
during his reign. One day he heard a sound of female lamentation
which proceeded from the Sciences who were becoming
mastered by the austere Sage, Vi&ccedil;vamitra, in a way they had
never been before. He rushed to their assistance as a Kshatriya
bound to succour the oppressed. By a haughty speech he provoked
Vi&ccedil;vamitra, and in consequence of his wrath the Sciences
instantly perished. (In the &lsquo;Chanda Kau&ccedil;ikam,&rsquo; as far as I
remember, we are told that the anger of Vi&ccedil;vamitra interfered
with the success of his austerity.) The king says he had only
done his duty as a king, which involves the bestowal of gifts on
Br&aacute;hmans and the succour of the weak. Vi&ccedil;vamitra thereupon
demands from the king as a gift the whole earth, everything
but himself, his son, and his wife. The king gives it him.
Then Vi&ccedil;vamitra demands his sacrificial fee; the king goes to
Benares, followed by the relentless Sage, the ruler of &Ccedil;iva,
and is compelled to sell his wife. She is bought by a rich old
Br&aacute;hman. The son cries and the Br&aacute;hman buys him too.
But Hari&ccedil;chandra has not enough, even now, to satisfy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
Vi&ccedil;vamitra, so he sells himself to a Ch&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la, who is really Dharma,
the god of righteousness. The Ch&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la (man of the lowest
caste), carries off the king, bound, beaten, and confused. The
Ch&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la sends him to steal clothes in a cemetery. There he
lives twelve months. His wife comes to the cemetery to perform
the obsequies of her son, who had died from the bite of a
serpent. The two determine to burn themselves with the
corpse of their son. When Hari&ccedil;chandra, after placing his son
on the funeral pyre, is meditating on the Supreme Spirit, the lord
Hari N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;a Krish&#7751;a, all the gods arrive headed by Dharma
(righteousness) and accompanied by Vi&ccedil;vamitra. Dharma entreats
the king to desist from his rash enterprise, and Indra
announces to him that he, his wife, and his son have gained
heaven by their good works. Ambrosia and flowers are rained
by the god from the sky, and the king&rsquo;s son is restored to the
bloom of youth. The king, adorned with celestial clothing and
garments, and the queen, embrace their son. Hari&ccedil;chandra,
however, declares that he cannot go to heaven till he has received
his master the Ch&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la&rsquo;s permission, and paid him a
ransom. Dharma, the god of righteousness, then says that
he had miraculously assumed the form of a Ch&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la. The
king requests that his subjects may accompany him to heaven,
at least for one day. This request is granted by Indra; and
after Vi&ccedil;vamitra has inaugurated the king&rsquo;s son, Rohita&ccedil;va, as
his successor, Hari&ccedil;chandra, his friends and followers, all ascend
to heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
finger, though the smallest, is the most privileged of the five. It
is the one that knows everything.&rdquo; A Piedmontese mother says,
&ldquo;My little finger tells me everything&rdquo; (Gubernatis, <i>Zoological
Mythology</i>, vol. I. p. 166). We have a somewhat similar saying
in England. In a Russian story quoted by the same author in
the same work (vol. II. p. 151), an old woman while baking a
cake, cuts off her little finger and throws it into the fire. From
the little finger in the fire is born a strong dwarf who afterwards
does many wonderful things. In the tale of the five fingers
(&ldquo;Die Maehr von den fuenf Fingern,&rdquo; Haltrich&rsquo;s <i>Siebenbuergische
Maerchen</i>, p. 325), where each finger decides what it will do,
the little one says, &ldquo;I will help with wise counsel.&rdquo; In consequence
of this assistance, to this day, &ldquo;when any one has a
wise idea (Einfall), he says &lsquo;that his little finger told him that&rsquo;&rdquo;
(p. 327). In Finnish mythology we again find the little finger.
&ldquo;The Para, also originated in the Swedish Bjaeren or Bare,
a magical three-legged being, manufactured in various ways,
and which, says Castr&eacute;n, attained life and motion when its
possessor, cutting the little finger of his left hand, let three drops
of blood fall on it, at the same time pronouncing the proper
spell.&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Mythology of Finnland,&rdquo; <i>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</i> for
May 1857, p. 532.)</p>

<p>In Rink&rsquo;s <i>Tales and Traditions of the Eskimo</i>, p. 441, there is
an account of Kanak&rsquo;s visit to the man of the moon, where he
meets a woman who, he is warned, will take out his entrails if
she can only make him laugh. He follows the moon-man&rsquo;s
advice, which is to rub his leg with the nail of his little finger
when he can no longer keep from smiling, and so saves himself
from the old hag. Rishya &#346;ri&ntilde;ga (to return to the land of our
fairy tales) threw a drop of water from the nail of his little finger
on a Rakshas who, in the form of a tiger, was rushing to devour
him. The demon instantly quitted the tiger&rsquo;s body, and asked
the Rishi what he should do. He followed the holy man&rsquo;s instructions
and obtained m&ocirc;ksha (salvation)&mdash;see <i>Indian Antiquary</i>
for May 1873, p. 142, &ldquo;The Legend of Rishya &#346;ri&ntilde;ga,&rdquo; told
by V.&nbsp;N. Narasimmiyengar of Bangalor.</p>

<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nxv" id="nxv"></a>XV.&mdash;HOW KING BURTAL BECAME A FAK&Iacute;R.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxv">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. The Fak&iacute;r strikes the dead antelope with his wand (<i>ch&aacute;buk</i>),
as in &ldquo;Shekh Far&iacute;d,&rdquo; p. <a href="#Page_98">98</a>. In both cases Dunkn&iacute; says the
wand used was a long, slender piece of bamboo. I do not know
whether the bamboo is a lightning-plant. Possibly it is, being
a grass (some grasses are lightning-plants, see Fiske&rsquo;s <i>Myths
and Mythmakers</i>, pp. 56, 61), and also because its long slender
stems are lance-shaped. If it does belong to this class, naturally
a blow from a bamboo (or lightning) wand would give life, for,
says Fiske (<i>ib.</i> p. 60), &ldquo;the association of the thunder-storm
with the approach of summer has produced many myths in
which the lightning is symbolized as the life-renewing wand
of the victorious sun-god.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. The king tries to hide the ball in his hair. The wonderful
power and strength of hair appears in tales from all lands:
Signor de Gubernatis suggests that, in the case of solar heroes,
their hair is the sun&rsquo;s rays (<i>Zoological Mythology</i>, vol. I. p. 117,
vol. II. p. 154); and it seems to me possible that, just as the
<em>colour</em> of the solar hero&rsquo;s hair has been appropriated by Indian
fairy-tale princes who are not solar, the <em>qualities</em> of his hair
may have been attributed to that of folk-lore heroes who are not
solar, and may also have been the origin of some of the strange
superstitions prevalent about human hair. This theory, if
correct, would account for most of the strange things that I have
hitherto met about hair. It must be remembered that the sun&rsquo;s
rays are also his weapons; they turn to thunderbolts when the
sun is hidden in the rain-clouds (Gubernatis, <i>ib.</i> vol. I. pp. 9,
17), and also to lightning (see <i>ib.</i> vol. II. p. 10, where the sun
under the form of a bull is spoken of as the fire which sends
forth lightning).</p>

<p>First there is Samson, whose name, according to Gesenius,
means &ldquo;solar,&rdquo; &ldquo;like the sun.&rdquo; Of the hero Firud, it is told
&ldquo;that a single hair of his head has more strength in it than
many warriors&rdquo; (Gubernatis, <i>Zoological Mythology</i>, vol. I.
p. 117). Conan was the weakest man of the F&eacute;inn, because
they used to keep him cropped. &ldquo;He had but the strength of a
man; but if the hair should get leave to grow, there was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
strength of a man in him for every hair that was in his head;
but he was so cross that if the hair should grow he would kill
them all&rdquo; (Campbell&rsquo;s <i>Popular Tales of the West Highlands</i>,
vol. III. p. 396). At p. 91 of Schmidt&rsquo;s <i>Griechische Maerchen,
Sagen und Volkslieder</i>, is the story of a king, &ldquo;Der Capit&auml;n
Dreizehn,&rdquo; who is &ldquo;the strongest of his time,&rdquo; and who has
three long hairs, so long that they could be twisted twice round
the hand on his breast. When these are cut off he becomes the
weakest of men. When these grow again he regains his
strength. The sun&rsquo;s rays have most power when they are
longest, <i>i.e.</i> when the sun is in apogee.</p>

<p>Possibly from this old forgotten myth about the solar hero&rsquo;s
hair came some superstition to which was due the Merovingian
decree that only princes of the blood-royal should wear their
hair long; cutting their long hair made them incapable of becoming
kings. Their slaves were shaved. The barbarians
ruled that only their free men should wear long hair, and that
the slaves should be shaved. Professor Monier Williams, in the
<i>Contemporary Review</i> for January 1879, p. 265, says that Govind,
the 10th Guru and founder of the Sikh nationality, ordered the
Sikhs to wear their hair long to distinguish themselves from
other nations.</p>

<p>In the Slavonic story, &ldquo;Leben, Abenteuer und Schwaenke des
kleinen Kerza,&rdquo; is a dwarf magician with a long white beard.
With a hair from this beard Kerza binds the magician&rsquo;s wicked
wife, who has taken the form of a wooden pillar the better to carry
out her evil ends. From that moment it was impossible for her
to take again her own shape or to use her former magic powers
(Vogl&rsquo;s <i>Volksmaerchen</i>, p. 227). One of the tasks set by Yspaddaden
Penkawr to Kilhwch before he will give him his daughter
Olwen to wife, is to get him &ldquo;a leash made from the beard
of Dissull Varvawc, for that is the only one that can hold
the two cubs. And the leash will be of no avail unless it be
plucked from his beard while he is alive, and twitched out
with wooden tweezers ... and the leash will be of no use
should he be dead because it will be brittle,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, when the
sun is set (dead) his rays have no power (<i>Mabinogion</i>,
vol. II. p. 288). The same idea lies at the bottom of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
English superstition that &ldquo;if a person&rsquo;s hair burn brightly
when thrown into the fire, it is a sign of longevity; the brighter
the flame, the longer the life. On the other hand, if it smoulder
away, and refuse to burn, it is a sign of approaching death&rdquo;
(Henderson&rsquo;s <i>Folk-lore of the Northern Counties of England</i>,
p. 84).</p>

<p>The Malays have a story of a woman, called Utahigi, in
whose head grew a single white hair endowed with magic power.
When her husband pulled it out a great storm arose and Utahigi
went up to heaven. She was a bird (or cloud) maiden, and this
hair must have been the lightning drawn from the cloud. The
Servian Atalanta, when nearly overtaken by her lover, takes a
hair from the top of her head and throws it behind her. It
becomes a mighty wood (clouds are the forests and mountains
of the sky, Gubernatis, <i>Zoological Mythology</i>, vol. I. p. 11),
Karadschitsch, <i>Volksmaerchen der Serben</i>, p. 25, in the story
&ldquo;von dem Maedchen das behender als das Pferd ist.&rdquo; In
Schmidt&rsquo;s <i>Griechische Maerchen, Sagen und Volkslieder</i>, p. 79,
the king&rsquo;s daughter as she flies with her lover from the Lamnissa
throws some of her own hairs behind her, and they become a
great lake (thunderbolts and lightning bring rain). At p. 98 of
the same work is the story &ldquo;Der Riese vom Berge.&rdquo; When
this giant wishes to enter his great high mountain, he takes a
hair from his head and touches the mountain with it. The
mountain at once splits in two (p. 101). The king&rsquo;s daughter in
her encounter with the Efreet, &ldquo;plucked a hair from her head
and muttered with her lips, whereupon the hair became converted
into a piercing sword with which she struck the lion [the
Efreet], and he was cleft in twain by her blow; but his head
became changed into a scorpion&rdquo; (Lane&rsquo;s <i>Arabian Nights</i>, vol.
I. p. 156). A Baba Yaga, in Ralston&rsquo;s <i>Russian Folk Tales</i>,
p. 147, plucks one of her hairs, ties three knots in it, and blows,
and thus petrifies her victims. She is a personification of the
spirit of the storm, <i>ib.</i> p. 164. In <i>Old Deccan Days</i>, at p. 62, the
old Rakshas says to Ramchundra, &ldquo;You must not touch my
hair;&rdquo; &ldquo;the least fragment of my hair thrown in the direction
of the jungle would instantly set it in a blaze.&rdquo; Ramchundra
steals two or three of the hairs, and when escaping from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
Rakshas, flings them to the winds and fires the jungle. Chandra
(p. 266 of the same book) avenges the death of her husband
by tearing her hair, which burns and instantly sets fire
to the land; all the people in it but herself and a few who had
been kind to her and are therefore saved, were burnt in this great
fire.</p>

<p>In these tales a single hair from the head of the Princess
Lab&aacute;m (the lunar ray can pierce the cloud as well as a solar
ray) cuts a thick tree-trunk in two, p. <a href="#Page_163">163</a>.</p>

<p>Hair has another property; it can tell things to its owners.
See the three hairs the Queen gives Coachman Toms, saying,
&ldquo;They will always tell you the truth when you question them.&rdquo;
(Stier&rsquo;s <i>Ungarische Volksmaerchen</i>, p. 176), and which, later in
the story (p. 186) adjudge the king worthy of death. (See
Grimm&rsquo;s story <i>Kinder und Hausmaerchen</i>, vol. II. p. 174, &ldquo;The
clear sun brings day.&rdquo;) Also &ldquo;Das wunderbare Haar&rdquo;
(Karadschitsch <i>Volksmaerchen der Serben</i>, p. 180), which is
blood-red, and in which when split open were found written a
multitude of noteworthy events from the beginning of the world.
(The sun&rsquo;s rays have existed since the early ages of the world.)
The girl from whose head the hair is taken threads a needle
with the sun&rsquo;s rays and embroiders a net made of the hair of
heroes.</p>

<p>See, too, the Eskimo account of the removal of Disco Island
in Rink&rsquo;s <i>Tales and Traditions of the Eskimo</i>, p. 464, where one
old man vainly tries to keep back the island by means of a
seal-skin thong which snaps, while two other old men haul it
away triumphantly by the hair from the head of a little child,
chanting their spells all the time. Their success was, perhaps,
due to the spells, not to the hair. In the notes to Der Capit&auml;n
Dreizehn in Schmidt&rsquo;s <i>Griechische Maerchen, Sagen und
Volkslieder</i>, there are some instances of the strength given by
hair to those on whom it grows.</p>

<p>2. The l&iacute;ch&iacute; is Nephelium Litchi.</p>

<p>3. King Burtal&rsquo;s eldest son&rsquo;s name <i>Saz&aacute;d&aacute;</i> is perhaps the
boy&rsquo;s title Shahz&aacute;d&aacute; (born of a king), prince. Dunkn&iacute; says it is
his name.</p>

<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nxvi" id="nxvi"></a>XVI.&mdash;SOME OF THE DOINGS OF SHEKH FAR&Iacute;D.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxvi">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. Khel&aacute;par&iacute; means &ldquo;playful fairy:&rdquo; Gul&aacute;bs&aacute;, &ldquo;like a rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. In another version told to me this year by Dunkn&iacute;, when
Gursan R&aacute;j&aacute; wakes and learns how long his wife has stood by
him, he is horrified, and refuses the water, saying he does not
want it. He tells her that as a reward for her patience and
goodness, she shall know of herself everything that happens in
other countries&mdash;floods, fires, and other troubles; that she shall
be able to bring help; and should any one die from having his
throat cut she shall be able to restore him to life, by smearing
the wound with some blood taken from an incision in her little
finger. Khel&aacute;par&iacute;&rsquo;s acquaintance with Shekh Far&iacute;d begins in this
version as follows:&mdash;She was standing at the door of her house
looking down the road, when she saw coming towards her
Shekh Far&iacute;d, the cartman, and the bullock-cart laden with what
once was sugar, but now, thanks to the fak&iacute;r, is ashes. Through
her gift Khel&aacute;par&iacute; knows all that has happened, though the
miracle was not performed in her sight; and Shekh Far&iacute;d being
a fak&iacute;r, though his all-knowing talent does not equal hers,
knows that she knows. The cartman is in despair when he discovers
the ashes, and implores Shekh Far&iacute;d to help him. The
fak&iacute;r sends him to Khel&aacute;par&iacute;, saying he must appeal to her as
her power of doing good excels his (the fak&iacute;r&rsquo;s); that though he
could turn sugar to ashes, he could not turn the ashes to sugar.
Khel&aacute;par&iacute; at the cartman&rsquo;s prayer performs this miracle. Their
next encounter is by a tank in the jungle by which the holy
man is resting. She is hurrying along to put out the fire at
her father&rsquo;s palace. The Shekh cannot understand how it is
possible for any woman to know of herself what is happening
twenty miles off, when he, a fak&iacute;r, can only know what passes
at a short distance, so he follows the R&aacute;n&iacute; to test her truthfulness,
and arrives in time to see her helping to put out the fire.
The rest of the story is the same as the version printed in this
collection.</p>

<p>3. This Shekh Far&iacute;d was a famous S&uacute;f&iacute; saint. He was a contemporary
of N&aacute;nak, and many of his sayings are embodied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
in the Granth. In Central India, there is a holy hill of his called
Girur. The Gazetteer of the Central Provinces edited by C.
Grant, 2nd edition, N&aacute;gpur, 1870, says that articles of merchandise
belonging to two travelling traders who mocked the saint
passed before him, on which he turned the whole stock-in-trade
into stones as a punishment. They implored his pardon, and
he created a fresh stock for them from dry leaves, on which they
were so struck by his power that they attached themselves permanently
to his service, and two graves on the hill are said to
be theirs. In the <i>Pioneer</i> for 5th August 1878, Pekin has a
poem on a similar legend about the saint. Standing on his
holy hill, one day Shekh Far&iacute;d saw a packman pass and he
begged for alms. The packman mocked him. Then the saint
asked what his sacks contained. &ldquo;Stones,&rdquo; was the answer.
The Shekh said, &ldquo;Sooth&mdash;they are but worthless stones.&rdquo;
Whereupon all the sacks burst, and the contents, at one time
different kinds of spices, fell stones to the ground. The owner
implored the saint&rsquo;s mercy. Shekh Far&iacute;d told him to fill his
sacks with leaves from the trees, which was done, and then
the leaves became gold mohurs. The packman turned saint
too and left his bones on Girur. A similar miracle is told of
the Irish Saint, Brigit. &ldquo;Once upon a time Brigit beheld a man
with salt on his back. &lsquo;What is that on thy back?&rsquo; saith
Brigit; &lsquo;Stones,&rsquo; saith the man. &lsquo;They shall be stones then,&rsquo;
saith Brigit, and of the salt stones were made. The same
man again cometh to (or past) Brigit. &lsquo;What is that on thy
back?&rsquo; saith Brigit. &lsquo;Salt,&rsquo; saith the man. &lsquo;It shall be salt
then,&rsquo; saith Brigit. Salt was made again thereof through Brigit&rsquo;s
word.&rdquo; (<i>Three Middle Irish Homilies</i>, p. 81.)</p>

<p>4. Fak&iacute;rchand means the moon of fak&iacute;rs. Mohand&aacute;s, the
servant of the Mohan (Krish&#7751;a). Champ&aacute;k&aacute;l&iacute; is a necklace
made in imitation of the closed buds of the champa or champak
flowers.</p>

<p>5. The demons, in Hind&uacute;st&aacute;n&iacute; <i>dew</i> (pronounced deo), god,
are something like the Rakshases. They have wings, and
have exceedingly long lips, one of which sticks up in the air,
while the other hangs down. One of King Arthur&rsquo;s warriors,
&ldquo;Gwevyl, the son of Gwestad, on the day that he was sad, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
would let one of his lips drop below his waist while he turned
up the other like a cap upon his head&rdquo; (<i>Mabinogion</i>,
vol. II. p. 266, &ldquo;Kilhwch and Olwen&rdquo;).</p>


<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nxvii" id="nxvii"></a>XVII.&mdash;THE MOUSE.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxvii">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. Unluckily, when Kar&iacute;m was with us, I neglected to write
down the name of the grain that kills the mouse, and all the
wonderful things he told us of the properties of this grain. His
explanations were a kind of note given after he had finished the
story.</p>

<p>2. The only parallel I can find to this story is one in Bleek&rsquo;s
<i>Hottentot Fables and Tales</i>, p. 90, called &ldquo;The unreasonable
child to whom the dog gave its deserts; or a receipt for putting
any one to sleep,&rdquo; in which the child indulges in the uncalled
for generosity and unreasonable rage of the mouse.</p>


<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nxviii" id="nxviii"></a>XVIII.&mdash;A WONDERFUL STORY.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxviii">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. Aj&iacute;t means unsubdued, invincible.</p>

<p>2. The wrestler&rsquo;s mode of announcing his arrival at Aj&iacute;t&rsquo;s house
is, probably, the solitary result of many efforts to induce Kar&iacute;m
himself to knock at the nursery door before he marched into
the nursery. I never heard of natives knocking at each other&rsquo;s
house-doors.</p>

<p>3. With these wrestlers compare Grimm&rsquo;s &ldquo;Der junge Riese,&rdquo;
<i>Kinder und Hausmaerchen</i>, vol. II. p. 23, and &ldquo;Eisenhans&rdquo; in
Haltrich&rsquo;s <i>Siebenbuergische Maerchen</i>, p. 77.</p>

<p>4. Aj&iacute;t carries her house. Note by Mr. J.&nbsp;F. Campbell:
&ldquo;Compare an Irish story about Fionn and a giant who was
told that the hero turned the house when the wind blew open
the door.&rdquo; [See, too, Campbell&rsquo;s <i>Tales of the Western Highlands</i>,
vol. III. p. 184]</p>

<p>5. When Kar&iacute;m was here I forgot to ask him how big were
Aj&iacute;t&rsquo;s cakes, can, and mice. Mr. Campbell of Islay, who read
this story in manuscript, wrote in the margin where the mice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
were mentioned: &ldquo;The fleas in the island of Java are so big
that they come out from under the bed and steal potatoes. They
do many such things. Compare [with Aj&iacute;t&rsquo;s can] a Gaelic story
about a man who found the Fenians in an island, and was
offered a drink in a can so large that he could not move it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>6. Mr. G.&nbsp;H. Damant, in the <i>Indian Antiquary</i> for September
1873, vol. II. p. 271, has a Din&aacute;jpur story called &ldquo;Two g&aacute;nja-eaters&rdquo;
which is very like our Wonderful Story. In it a g&aacute;nja-eater
who can eat six maunds of g&aacute;nja<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> hears of another
g&aacute;nja-eater who can eat nine maunds; so he takes his six
maunds of g&aacute;nja, and sets off for his rival&rsquo;s country with the
intention of fighting him. On the road he is thirsty and drinks
a whole pond dry, but this fails to quench his thirst. Arrived
at the nine-maund g&aacute;nja-eater&rsquo;s house, he learns from the wife
that her husband has gone to cut sugar-cane, and decides to
go and meet him. He finds him in the jungle, and wishes to
fight there and then; but his rival does not agree to this, saying
he has eaten nothing for seven days. The other answers he
has eaten nothing for nine; whereupon the nine-maund g&aacute;nja-eater
suggests they shall wait till they get back to his country,
as in the jungle they will have no spectators. The six-maund
g&aacute;nja-eater consents. So the nine-maund g&aacute;nja-eater takes up
all the sugar-cane he has cut during the last seven days and
sets off for his country with his rival. On the way they meet a
fish-wife, and call her to stop and see them fight; she answers
she must carry her fish without delay to market, being already
late, and proposes they should stand on her arm and fight, and
that then she could see them as they go along. While they
are fighting on her arm, down sweeps a kite which carries off
&ldquo;the g&aacute;nja-eaters; fish and all.&rdquo; They are thrown by a storm
in front of a R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s daughter, who has them swept away thinking
they are bits of straw.</p>

<p>2. With the transmigration of the souls of the merchant&rsquo;s
father, grandmother, and sister into the goat, the old woman
and his little daughter, compare a Din&aacute;jpur story published by
Mr. G.&nbsp;H. Damant in the <i>Indian Antiquary</i> for June 7, 1872,
vol. I. p. 172, in which a king threatens to kill a Br&aacute;hman if he
does not explain what he means by saying to the king every day,
&ldquo;As thy liberality, so thy virtue.&rdquo; By his new-born daughter&rsquo;s
advice the Br&aacute;hman tells the king this child would explain it to
him. Accordingly the king comes to the Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s house and
is received smilingly &ldquo;by the two-and-a-half-days-old daughter.
She sends the king for the desired information to a certain red
ox, who in his turn&rdquo; sends him to a clump of Shahara (<i>Trophis
aspera</i>) trees. The trees tell him he has been made king in this
state of existence, because in a former state of existence he was
liberal and full of charity; that in this former state the child just
born as the Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s daughter was his wife: that the red ox
was then his son, and that this son&rsquo;s wife, as a punishment for
her hardness and uncharitableness, had &ldquo;become the genius of
this grove of trees.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nxx" id="nxx"></a>XX.&mdash;THE BOY WHO HAD A MOON ON HIS FOREHEAD
AND A STAR ON HIS CHIN.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxx">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. For these marks see paragraph 4 of the notes to Ph&uacute;lmati
R&aacute;n&iacute;. I think the silver chains with which King Oriant&rsquo;s children
are born (see the Netherlandish story, the Knight of the
Swan, quoted in paragraph 3 of the notes to the Pomegranate
King) are identical with the suns, moons, and stars that the hero
in this and in many other tales possesses. They are his princely
insignia and proofs of his royalty. When the boy in this tale
twists his right ear his insignia are hidden, and so long as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
remain concealed no one can guess he is a king&rsquo;s son, unless
he chooses to reveal himself, as he does, partially, through his
sweet singing to the youngest princess. With this partial revelation
compare the Sicilian &ldquo;Stupid Peppe&rdquo; revealing himself
in part by means of the ring he gave to his youngest princess.
This ring has the property of flashing brightly whenever he is
near. (See the story &ldquo;Von dem muthigen K&ouml;nigssohn, der viele
Abenteuer erlebte&rdquo; quoted in paragraph 6 of the notes to this
story, p. <a href="#Page_280">280</a>.) The shape of the insignia may have been
destroyed, as in the case of the sixth swan&rsquo;s chain, in the Netherlandish
story, but its substance remains, and as soon as it reappears
the hero clothes himself with his own royal form.
Chundun R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s necklace (<i>Old Deccan Days</i>, p. 230) and
Sodewa Bai&rsquo;s necklace (<i>ib.</i> p. 236), in which lay their life, belong,
perhaps, to these insignia. Their princely owners&rsquo; existence
depends on their keeping these proofs of their royalty in their
own possession, and is suspended whenever the proofs pass into
the hands of others.</p>

<p>2. The gardener&rsquo;s daughter promises to bear her husband a
son with the moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.
Compare &ldquo;Die verstossene K&ouml;nigin und ihre beiden ausgesetzten
Kinder,&rdquo; Gonzenbach&rsquo;s <i>Sicilianische Maerchen</i>, vol. I.
p. 19, where the girl (p. 21) promises to give the king, if he
marries her, a son with a golden apple in his hand, and a
daughter with a silver star on her forehead. Also compare with
our story &ldquo;Truth&rsquo;s Triumph&rdquo; in <i>Old Deccan Days</i>, p. 50. In
Indian stories, as in European tales, the gardener and his family
often play an important part, the hero being frequently the son
of the gardener&rsquo;s daughter, or else protected by the gardener
and his wife.</p>

<p>3. With the kettle-drum compare the golden bell given by the
R&aacute;j&aacute; to Guzra Bai in &ldquo;Truth&rsquo;s Triumph&rdquo; (<i>Old Deccan Days</i>,
p. 53); and the flute given by the nymph Tillottama to her
husband in the &ldquo;Finding of the Dream,&rdquo; a Din&aacute;jpur story
published by Mr. G.&nbsp;H. Damant in the <i>Indian Antiquary</i>,
February 1875, vol. IV. p. 54. See also paragraph 7, p. <a href="#Page_287">287</a>, of
notes to &ldquo;How the R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s son won the Princess Lab&aacute;m.&rdquo;</p>

<p>4. <i>Ka&#7789;ar</i> (the <i>t</i> is lingual) means cruel, relentless. With this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
fairy-horse compare the Russian hero-horses in Dietrich&rsquo;s collection
of Russian tales, who remain shut up behind twelve iron
doors, and often loaded with chains as well, till the advent of
heroes great enough to ride them. They generally speak with
human voices, are their masters&rsquo; devoted servants, fight for him,
often slaughtering more of his enemies than he does himself, and
when turned loose in the free fields, as Ka&#7789;ar was in his jungle,
till they are needed, always staying in them and coming at once
to their master when he calls. See in the collection by Dietrich
(<i>Russische Volksmaerchen</i>) No. 1, &ldquo;Von Ljubim Zarewitch,&rdquo;
&amp;c., p. 3; No. 2, &ldquo;Von der selbstspielenden Harfe,&rdquo; p. 17;
No. 4, &ldquo;Von Ritter Iwan, dem Bauersohne,&rdquo; p. 43; No. 10,
&ldquo;Von Bulat dem braven Burschen,&rdquo; p. 133; Jeruslan Lasarewitsch
in the story that bears his name (No. 17, p. 208) catches
and tames a wonderful horse near which even lions and eagles
do not dare to go, p. 214. And the Hungarian fairy horses
(Zauberpferde) who, like the Servian hero-horses, become ugly
and lame at pleasure, and speak with human voice, must also
be compared to Ka&#7789;ar. One in particular plays a leading part
in the story of &ldquo;Weissnittle&rdquo; (Stier&rsquo;s <i>Ungarische Volksmaerchen</i>,
p. 61). He saves the king&rsquo;s son twice from death and then flies
with him to another land. He speaks with human voice, advises
him in all his doings, and marries him to a king&rsquo;s daughter;
Weissnittle obeying his horse as implicitly as our hero does
Ka&#7789;ar. The heroes&rsquo; horses in Haltrich&rsquo;s <i>Siebenbuergische Maerchen</i>
also speak with human voice and give their masters good
counsel. See p. 35 of &ldquo;Der goldne Vogel;&rdquo; p. 49 of &ldquo;Der
Zauberross;&rdquo; p. 101 of &ldquo;Der Knabe und der Schlange.&rdquo; These
last two horses have more than four legs: like Odin&rsquo;s Sleipnir,
they each have eight. See, too, the dragon&rsquo;s horse and this
horse&rsquo;s brother in &ldquo;Der goldne Apfelbaum und die neun
Pfauinnen&rdquo; (Karadschitsch, <i>Volksmaerchen der Serben</i>, pp. 33-40).
The &ldquo;steed&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Rider of Grianaig,&rdquo; pp. 14 and
15 of vol. III. of Campbell&rsquo;s <i>Tales of the Western Highlands</i>,
and the &ldquo;Shaggy dun filly&rdquo; in &ldquo;The young king of Easaidh
Ruadh,&rdquo; at p. 4 of vol. I. of the same work, may also be compared;
and, lastly, in a list of hero-horses C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s Gray
of Macha deserves a place. On the morning of the day which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
was to see his last fight, C&uacute;chulainn ordered his charioteer, Loeg,
to harness the Gray to his chariot. &ldquo;&lsquo;I swear to God what my
people swears,&rsquo; said Loeg, &lsquo;though the men of Conchobar&rsquo;s
fifth (Ulster) were around the Gray of Macha, they could not
bring him to the chariot.... If thou wilt, come thou, and speak
with the Gray himself.&rsquo; C&uacute;chulainn went to him. And thrice
did the horse turn his left side to his master.... Then C&uacute;chulainn
reproached his horse, saying that he was not wont to deal
thus with his master. Thereat the Gray of Macha came and
let his big round tears of blood fall on C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo; The
hero then leaps into his chariot, and goes to battle. At last the
Gray is sore wounded, and he and C&uacute;chulainn bid each other
farewell. The Gray leaves his master; but when C&uacute;chulainn,
wounded to death, has tied himself to a stone pillar to die
standing, &ldquo;then came the Gray of Macha to C&uacute;chulainn to protect
him so long as his soul abode in him, and the &lsquo;hero&rsquo;s light&rsquo;
out of his forehead remained. Then the Gray of Macha wrought
the three red routs all around him. And fifty fell by his teeth
and thirty by each of his hooves. This is what he slew of the
host. And hence is (the saying) &lsquo;Not keener were the victorious
courses of the Gray of Macha after C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s
slaughter.&rsquo;&rdquo; Then Lugaid and his men cut off the hero&rsquo;s head
and right hand and set off, driving the Gray before them. They
met Conall the Victorious, who knew what had happened when
he saw his friend&rsquo;s horse. &ldquo;And he and the Gray of Macha
sought C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s body. They saw C&uacute;chulainn at the pillar-stone.
Then went the Gray of Macha and laid his head on
C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s breast. And Conall said, &lsquo;A heavy care to the
Gray of Macha is that corpse.&rsquo;&rdquo; Conall himself, in the fight he
has with Lugaid, to avenge his friend&rsquo;s slaughter, is helped by
his own horse, the Dewy-Red. &ldquo;When Conall found that he
prevailed not, he saw his steed, the Dewy-Red, by Lugaid.
And the steed came to Lugaid and tore a piece out of his
side.&rdquo; (&ldquo;C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s Death, abridged from the Book of
Leinster,&rdquo; <i>Revue celtique</i>, Juin 1877, pp. 175, 176, 180, 182, 183,
185.)</p>

<p>5. The prince makes his escape at five years old. Jeruslan
Jeruslanowitsch at the same age sets out in search of his father,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
Jeruslan Lasarewitsch, equipped as a knight, at p. 250 of the
17th Russian Maerchen in the collection by Dietrich quoted
above. He meets and fights bravely with his father, proving
himself worthy of him (p. 251). Sohrab, Rustam&rsquo;s famous
son, gives proof of a lion&rsquo;s courage at five, and at ten years
old vanquishes all his companions (Gubernatis, <i>Zoological
Mythology</i>, vol. I. p. 115).</p>

<p>6. The princess chooses the ugly common-looking man. In
<i>Old Deccan Days</i>, p. 119, so does the Princess Buccoulee. In
the episode of Nala and Damayant&iacute; we have the assemblage of
suitors, and the public choice of a husband by a princess (<i>svayamvara</i>).
Damayant&iacute; recognizes the mortal Nala among the gods,
(each of whom has made himself resemble Nala) from the fact
that the flowers of which Nala&rsquo;s garlands were composed had
faded while the garlands of the gods were blooming freshly.
In a story from Man&iacute;p&uacute;r&iacute; told by Mr. G.&nbsp;H. Damant in the
<i>Indian Antiquary</i>, September 1875, vol. IV. p. 260, Prince
Basanta, effectually disguised by misery, and travel-stained,
arrives with the merchant at a certain place where the king&rsquo;s
daughter that day is to choose her husband. The merchant
takes his seat among the princely suitors; Basanta a little way
off. There is a general storm of scoffings when the princess
hangs her garland of flowers round Basanta&rsquo;s neck. In one
of Laura Gonzenbach&rsquo;s Sicilian stories, &ldquo;Von einem muthigen
K&ouml;nigssohn, der viele Abenteuer erlebte,&rdquo; vol. II. p. 21, we have
three kings&rsquo; sons (brothers) and three princesses (sisters.) The
two elder brothers marry the two elder sisters. At a tournament
held on purpose that she may choose her husband, the youngest
sister, to the general disgust, chooses the youngest prince (disguised
as the dirty, ill-dressed servant of the court tailor), and
who is not even present as a suitor. Her suitors, princes, have
passed before her for three days. After the marriage the
prince keeps up the disguise. His brothers by way of amusing
themselves at his expense take &ldquo;Stupid Peppe,&rdquo; as they call him,
to the wood to shoot birds; he shoots a great number, while
they run here and there and cannot find one. They agree to
let him brand them with black spots on their shoulders, on
condition he gives them his birds. In the notes to this story,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
vol. II. p. 240. Herr K&ouml;hler gives Spanish, Russian, South
Siberian, and others parallels. And in Stier&rsquo;s <i>Ungarische
Volksmaerchen</i>, p. 61, in the story of &ldquo;Weissnittle,&rdquo; we have not
only the hero-horse mentioned in paragraph 4 of these notes,
but also the assemblage of suitors for the princess to choose her
husband: her choice of a seemingly stupid gardener&rsquo;s boy, who
has partially revealed himself to her; the prince retaining his
disguise, after his marriage, towards every one, even his wife:
two brothers-in-law, who are kings&rsquo; sons and the wife&rsquo;s elder
sisters&rsquo; husbands; their hunting on three different days, each
time meeting a handsome prince in whom they do not recognize
their despised brother-in-law, Weissnittle, who sells them his
game the first day for their wedding-rings, the second for leave
to brand them with these rings on their foreheads, the third
for permission to brand them with a gallows on their backs:
lastly, we have Weissnittle, as a splendid young prince, publicly
shaming his brothers-in-law by exposing their branding
marks. In India this branding with red-hot pice was the punishment
for stealing. Compare in Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Confessions of a
Thug</i>, p. 411, Am&iacute;r Ali&rsquo;s horror at being so branded by the
R&aacute;j&aacute; of Jhalone. It was, he says years later, a punishment
worse than death, as the world would think him a thief, and he
would carry to his grave &ldquo;a mark only set on the vile and the
outcasts from society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>7. M&uacute;niy&aacute; tells me that, in a variation of this story, the dog,
cow, and horse each swallow the child three times, but for
shorter periods, as he is only five years old when he escapes
on Ka&#7789;ar. Then when the princess chooses her husband she
rides three times round the assemblage of R&aacute;j&aacute;&rsquo;s, who all sit
on a great plain, and each time she chooses the pretended <em>old</em>
man; for in this version the boy loses his youth as well as his
good looks. Instead of taking service with the grain merchant,
the boy is told by his horse to go boldly to the king&rsquo;s palace
and ask for service there. The shaming of the brothers-in-law
happens thus. The boy invites these princes, the king, all
the king&rsquo;s servants, and all the people in the king&rsquo;s country, to
a grand entertainment in the king&rsquo;s court-house. When they
are all assembled he has the six princes stripped and every one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span>
mocks at the pice-marks on their backs. These are the only
variations in the other version.</p>

<p>Sir George Grey, in his <i>Polynesian Mythology</i>, p. 73, tells how
the hero Tawhaki when he climbed into heaven in search of his
lost wife &ldquo;disguised himself, and changed his handsome and
noble appearance, and assumed the likeness of a very ugly old
man.&rdquo; If fact, he looks such a thoroughly common old man
that in the heavens he is taken for a slave instead of a great
chief, and treated as such.</p>


<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nxxi" id="nxxi"></a>XXI.&mdash;THE B&Eacute;L-PRINCESS.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxxi">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. M&uacute;niy&aacute; says that telling the prince he would marry a B&eacute;l-Princess
was equivalent to saying he would not marry at all, for
these brothers&rsquo; wives knew she lived in the fairy-country, and
that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for the prince to
find her, and take her from it.</p>

<p>2. With the fak&iacute;r&rsquo;s sleep compare that of the dragon who
sleeps for a year at a time in the Transylvanian story &ldquo;Das
Rosenmaerchen&rdquo; (<i>Siebenbuergische Maerchen</i>, pp. 124, 126).</p>

<p>3. In a Greek story, &ldquo;Das Schloss des Helios&rdquo; (Schmidt&rsquo;s
<i>Griechische Maerchen, Sagen und Volkslieder</i>, p. 106), the heroine
is warned by a monk that as she approaches the magic
castle voices like her brothers&rsquo; voices will call her; but if, consequently,
she looks behind she will become stone. Her two elder
brothers go to seek her, and, as they meet no monk to warn
them, they become stone. The third brother meets the monk,
obeys his warning, and thus, like his sister, escapes the evil fate.
To save him from Helios, the sister turns him into a thimble
till she has Helios&rsquo;s promise to do him no harm. (Compare the
Tiger and Tigress, p. <a href="#Page_155">155</a> of this collection.) Helios gives him
some water in a flask with which he sprinkles the stone brothers,
whereupon they and all the other stone princes come to life.
In these Indian tales the healing blood from the little finger
plays the part of the waters of life and death, found in so many
Russian and other European stories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
When reading of the fate of all these princes, it is impossible
not to think of Lot&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p>The danger of looking back, when engaged on any
dealings with supernatural powers, is insisted on in the tales
and practices of the Russians, Eskimos, Zulus, and the
Khonds of Orissa. In Russia the watcher for the golden fern-flower
must seize it the instant it blossoms and run home,
taking care not to look behind him: whether through fear of
giving the demons, who also watch for it, power over him, or
whether through a dread of the flower losing its magic powers
if this precaution is neglected, Mr. Ralston does not say
(<i>Songs of the Russian People</i>, p. 99). When &ldquo;the Revived
who came to the under-world people&rdquo; (Dr. Rink tells us in his
<i>Tales and Traditions of the Eskimo</i>, p. 299) took the old couple
to visit the ingnersuit (supernatural beings &ldquo;who have their
abodes beneath the surface of the earth, in the cliffs along the
sea-shore, where the ordinarily invisible entrances to them are
found&rdquo; <i>ib.</i> p. 46), he warned &ldquo;them not to look back when
they approached the rock which enclosed the abode of the
ingnersuit, lest the entrance should remain shut for them....
When they had reached the cliff, and were rowing up to it,
it forthwith opened; and inside was seen a beautiful country,
with many houses, and a beach covered with pebbles and large
heaps of fish and matak (edible skin). Perceiving this the old
people for joy forgot the warning and turned round, and
instantly all disappeared: the prow of the boat knocked right
against the steep rock and was smashed in, so that they all
were thrown down by the shock. The son [the revived] said,
&lsquo;Now we must remain apart for ever.&rsquo;&rdquo; Mr. Tylor, in the 2nd
volume of his <i>Primitive Culture</i>, at p. 147 mentions a Zulu
remedy for preventing a dead man from tormenting his widow
in her dreams; the sorcerer goes with her to lay the ghost,
and when this is done &ldquo;charges her not to look back till she gets
home:&rdquo; and he says the Khonds of Orissa, when offering human
sacrifices to the earth-goddess bury their portions of the offering
in holes in the ground behind their backs without looking round
(<i>ib.</i> p. 377).</p>

<p>4. In most of the stories of this kind the command is to open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
the fruit or casket only near water, for if the beautiful maiden
inside cannot get water immediately she dies. Such is the case
in the &ldquo;Drei Pomeranzen&rdquo; (Stier&rsquo;s <i>Ungarische Maerchen und
Sagen</i>, p. 83), in &ldquo;Die Schoene mit dem sieben Schleier&rdquo; (<i>Sicilianische
Maerchen</i>, vol. I. p. 73), and in &ldquo;Die drei Citronen&rdquo;
(Schmidt&rsquo;s <i>Griechische Maerchen, Sagen und Volkslieder</i>, p. 71).
&ldquo;Die Ungeborene Niegesehene&rdquo; (Schott&rsquo;s <i>Wallachische Maerchen</i>,
p. 248) must be compared with these, though the beautiful
maiden does not come out of the golden fairy-apple. She appears
suddenly and the prince must give her water to drink and
the apple to eat, before he can take her and keep her. In all
these stories the hero has a long journey, and encounters many
dangers, in seeking his bride. In the Sicilian story he is helped
by hermits; in the Greek story, by a monk&mdash;monks in Greek and
hermits in Sicilian and Servian stories playing the part of the
fak&iacute;rs in these Indian tales. In all these stories, too, the maiden
is killed or transformed by a wicked woman who takes her place.
In the Wallachian and Sicilian fairy tales the rightful bride
becomes a dove only. But in the Hungarian tale she is drowned
in a well and becomes a gold fish; the wicked gipsy has no rest
till she has eaten the fish&rsquo;s liver: from one of its scales springs
a tree; she has the tree cut down and burnt. The wood-cutter
who hews down the tree makes a cover for his wife&rsquo;s
milk-pot from a piece of the wood, and they find their house
kept in beautiful order from this moment. So to discover
the secret, they peep through the keyhole one day and see
a lovely fairy come out of the milk-jar. Then they enter
their house suddenly and the girl tells her story: the wood-cutter&rsquo;s
wife burns the wooden lid to force her to keep
her own form, and goes to the king&rsquo;s son to tell him where
he will find his Pomegranate-bride again. In the Greek story
a Lamnissa eats the citron-girl, but a tiny bone falls unnoticed
into the water and becomes a gold-fish. The prince not only
takes the Lamnissa home with him, but he takes the gold-fish
too, and keeps it in his room, &ldquo;for he loved it dearly.&rdquo; The
Lamnissa never rests till he gives her the fish to eat. Its bones
are thrown into a garden and from them springs a rose bush on
which blooms a rose which the king&rsquo;s old washerwoman wishes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
to break off to sell it at the castle. From out of the bush
springs the beautiful citron-maiden, and tells the old woman
her story. She also gives her the rose for the king&rsquo;s son, and
in the basket with the rose she lays a ring he had given her, but
charges the old woman to say nothing about her to him. The
next day he comes to the old woman&rsquo;s cottage and finds his real
bride.</p>

<p>5. The youngest prince alone can gather the lotus-flower and
b&eacute;l-fruit. Compare the Pomegranate-king, pp. <a href="#Page_10">10</a> and <a href="#Page_11">11</a>, and
paragraphs 1 and 4, pp. <a href="#Page_245">245</a>, <a href="#Page_252">252</a>, of the notes to that story. In
his <i>Northern Mythology</i>, vol. I., in the footnotes at p. 290,
Thorpe mentions a maiden&rsquo;s grave from which spring &ldquo;three
lilies which no one save her lover may gather.&rdquo; I think he
must quote from a Danish ballad.</p>

<p>6. The princess after drowning is first in a lotus-flower; then
in a b&eacute;l-fruit again; and, lastly, her body is changed to a garden
and palace. Signor de Gubernatis at p. 152 of the 1st volume of
his <i>Zoological Mythology</i> mentions an Esthonian story where a
girl (she who addressed the crow as &ldquo;bird of light&rdquo;&mdash;see paragraph
2, p. 259 of the notes to &ldquo;Brave H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;lb&aacute;s&aacute;&rdquo;) while
fleeing with her lover is thrown into the water by a magic ball
sent after them by the old witch, and there becomes &ldquo;a pond-rose
(lotus-flower).&rdquo; Her lover eats hogs&rsquo;-flesh and thus learns the
language of birds, and then sends swallows to a magician in
Finnland to ask what he must do to free his bride. The answer
is brought by an eagle; and the prince following the magician&rsquo;s
instructions helps the girl to recover her human form. And just
as Surya Bai is born again in her mango (<i>Old Deccan Days</i>,
p. 87) and the B&eacute;l-Princess in her b&eacute;l-fruit, so is the girl in the
Hottentot tale of &ldquo;The Lion who took a woman&rsquo;s shape&rdquo; born
from her heart in the calabash full of milk in which her mother
has put it. The lion had eaten the girl; but her mother burns
the lion and persuades the fire in which she burns him to give
her her daughter&rsquo;s heart (Bleek&rsquo;s <i>Hottentot Fables and Tales</i>,
pp. 55 and 56). With the change into the garden and palace
compare the Russian story of a maiden whose servant-girl blinds
her and takes her place as the king&rsquo;s wife. After some time
the false queen learns her mistress is still living; so she has her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>286]</a></span>
murdered and cut to pieces. &ldquo;Where the maiden is buried a
garden arises, and a boy shows himself. The boy goes to the
palace and runs after the queen, making such a din that she is
obliged, in order to silence him, to give him the girl&rsquo;s heart
which she had kept hidden. The boy then runs off contented,
the king follows him, and finds himself before the resuscitated
maiden&rdquo; (Gubernatis, <i>Zoological Mythology</i>, vol. I. pp. 218,
219). See paragraphs 7 and 8 of the notes to &ldquo;Ph&uacute;lmati
R&aacute;n&iacute;,&rdquo; p. <a href="#Page_244">244</a>, and 1, 3 and 4, pp. <a href="#Page_245">245</a>, <a href="#Page_250">250</a>, <a href="#Page_252">252</a>, of those to
&ldquo;The Pomegranate-king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>7. The commonplace fate of the wonderful palace is deplorable.</p>


<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nxxii" id="nxxii"></a>XXII.&mdash;HOW THE R&Aacute;J&Aacute;&rsquo;S SON WON THE
PRINCESS LAB&Aacute;M.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxxii">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. The &ldquo;four sides&rdquo; in this story (p. <a href="#Page_153">153</a>), the &ldquo;four directions&rdquo;
(p. <a href="#Page_156">156</a>) which ought to have been translated four sides
and the four sides in &ldquo;The Bed,&rdquo; p. <a href="#Page_202">202</a>, are the four points of
the compass. They appear in a Din&aacute;jpur story told by Mr. G.&nbsp;H.
Damant in the <i>Indian Antiquary</i>, 5th April 1872, p. 115.
In the first Russian fairy tale published by Dietrich, the
hero&rsquo;s parents give their elder sons permission &ldquo;to go on the
four sides&rdquo; when they start on their journeys (<i>Russische Volksmaerchen</i>,
p. 1). In another fairy tale in the same collection
(No. 11, p. 144) the Prince Malandrach, when he has lost his
way flying in the air and is over the sea, raises himself by a
last effort and looks on all the &ldquo;four sides&rdquo; in search of a
resting-place for his foot, p. 147. Of course, too, like orthodox
Russians, the Russian heroes generally bow to all the &ldquo;four
sides,&rdquo; before attempting their journeys and adventures.</p>

<p>2. H&iacute;r&aacute;man is the name of a kind of parroquet. Irik in the
Bohemian tale &ldquo;Princess Golden-Hair&rdquo; (Naake&rsquo;s <i>Slavonic
Fairy Tales</i>, p. 99) first hears of the princess&rsquo;s existence from
the chattering of birds.</p>

<p>3. &ldquo;Aunty&rdquo; was the word used in English by old M&uacute;niy&aacute;.</p>

<p>4. With the stone bowl compare the pot in Grimm&rsquo;s &ldquo;Der
suesse Brei,&rdquo; <i>Kinder und Hausmaerchen</i>, vol. II. p. 104.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
5. With the tigers&rsquo; coats compare the robes of honour wherewith
the knights in the Mabinogion clothe themselves when they
go to combat. &ldquo;And he (Gwalchmai) went forth to meet the
knight (Owain), having over himself and his horse a satin robe
of honour sent him by the daughter of the Earl of Rhangyw;
and in this dress he was not known by any of the host&rdquo;
(&ldquo;The Lady of the Fountain,&rdquo; <i>Mabinogion</i>, vol. I. p. 67).
Peredur wears &ldquo;a bright scarlet robe of honour over his armour&rdquo;
given him by the king&rsquo;s daughter (<i>ib.</i> p. 363 of &ldquo;Peredur the son
of Evrawc&rdquo;). And in &ldquo;The Dream of Rhonabwy&rdquo; a knight
and his horse wear a robe of honour (<i>ib.</i> vol. II. p. 413).</p>

<p>6. With the tigers&rsquo; fight with the demons compare the combat
of the grateful lion with the giant, in which the lion bears
the brunt of the battle. On the giant&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;Truly, I should
find no difficulty in fighting with thee were it not for the animal
that is with thee,&rdquo; Owain shuts the lion up in the castle. &ldquo;The
lion in the castle roared very loud, for he heard that it went
hard with Owain,&rdquo; so he climbed to the top of the castle, sprang
down and &ldquo;joined Owain. And the lion gave the giant a
stroke with his paw, which tore him from his shoulder to his
hip, and his heart was laid bare. And the giant fell down
dead&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Lady of the Fountain,&rdquo; <i>Mabinogion</i>, vol. I.
pp. 79, 80).</p>

<p>7. Gubernatis in vol. I. p. 160, of his <i>Zoological Mythology</i>,
says, &ldquo;The drum or kettle-drum thunder is a familiar image in
Hindu poetry, and the gandharvas, the musician warriors of the
Hindu Olympus, have no other instrument than the thunder.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The magic flute is a variation of the same celestial instrument,&rdquo;

<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nxxiii" id="nxxiii"></a>XXIII.&mdash;THE PRINCESS WHO LOVED HER FATHER
LIKE SALT.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxxiii">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. With the task of pulling out the needles, the purchase of
the maid-servant, the sleep of the princess, the usurping of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
place by the maid who makes the prince believe the princess
is her servant-girl, compare &ldquo;Der b&ouml;se Schulmeister und die
wandernde K&ouml;nigstochter,&rdquo; in Laura Gonzenbach&rsquo;s <i>Sicilianische
Maerchen</i>, vol. I. p. 59. Here, too, the princess is driven
forth from her home; she finds a prince lying dead with a tablet
by him on which is written, &ldquo;If a maiden will rub me seven
years, seven months and seven days long with grass from
Mount Calvary, I shall return to life, and she shall become my
wife&rdquo; (p. 61).</p>

<p>2. Sun-jewel box. The word thus translated is Rav-ratan-ke-pit&aacute;r&aacute;.
<i>Rav&iacute;</i>, sun; <i>ratan</i>, jewel; <i>pit&aacute;r&aacute;</i>, a kind of box.</p>

<p>3. In one of Grimm&rsquo;s stories, &ldquo;Die G&auml;nsehirtin am Brunnen,&rdquo;
<i>Kinder und Hausmaerchen</i>, vol. II. p. 419, a king asks his three
daughters how much they love him (p. 425). The eldest loves
him as much as the &ldquo;sweetest sugar,&rdquo; the second as much as
her &ldquo;finest dress,&rdquo; and the third as much as salt. So her father
in a rage has a sack of salt bound on her back, and makes two
of his servants take her away to the forest. See also Auerbach&rsquo;s
<i>Barf&uuml;ssele</i>, Stuttgart, 1873, ss. 236, 237.</p>


<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nxxiv" id="nxxiv"></a>XXIV.&mdash;THE DEMON IS AT LAST CONQUERED BY
THE KING&rsquo;S SON.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxxiv">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. The leading idea of this story is the same as that in &ldquo;Brave
H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;lb&aacute;s&aacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. With this demon as a goat, compare the Rakshas in the
Pig&rsquo;s Head Soothsayer in <i>Sagas from the Far East</i>, p. 63, and
the Rakshas in a Beng&aacute;li story printed by Mr. G.&nbsp;H. Damant
in the <i>Indian Antiquary</i>, 7th June, 1872, p. 120. This last
story opens with seven labourers, brothers, six of whom go
down to the water to drink and never return. The seventh goes
to see what has happened to them, and finds, instead of his
brothers, a goat which is really a Rakshas. This goat then turns
into a beautiful woman who marries the king, first making him
give into her hands the eyes of his queen, who is sent blind into
the forest, where she bears a little son. The Rakshas wife learns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
this, and when the boy later takes service with the king she sends
him three times to her people in Ceylon, with orders to them to
kill him. He has to bring her foam from the sea, a wonderful
rice which is sown, ripens, and can be boiled in one day, and a
singular cow. With the help of a Sanny&aacute;s&iacute; (a Br&aacute;hman of the
fourth order, a religious mendicant), he does these errands safely.
The Rakshases in Ceylon receive him as their sister&rsquo;s son, show
him his own mother&rsquo;s eyes and the clay with which they can be
set again in any human sockets, a lemon which contains the
life of the tribe, and a bird in which is that of the Rakshas-queen.
The boy cuts up the lemon, and thereby kills them
all, carries her eyes to his mother, and kills the Rakshas-queen
by killing the bird. In this story, as in &ldquo;Brave H&iacute;r&aacute;l&aacute;lb&aacute;s&aacute;,&rdquo;
the Rakshas-queen takes her own fearful form on seeing her
danger.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Bargat</i>, fig-tree, is the <i>Ficus Bengalensis</i> of Linn&aelig;us.</p>

<p>4. M&uacute;niy&aacute; sends her hero for a <i>Garpank&rsquo;s</i> feather; <i>Garpank</i>
I can find in no dictionary, but have ventured to translate it
by eagle, as she says it is like a kite, only very much bigger;
she sent us to see a statue of a garpank that stood over a gateway
in a street in Calcutta, which might be that of an eagle or
of a huge hawk. She said such birds did not exist in Bengal,
and that it was not the Garu&#7693;a (the sovran of the feathered
race and vehicle of Vish&#7751;u, Benfey). Gubernatis, in the 2nd
volume of his <i>Zoological Mythology</i>, p. 189, tells a story from
Monferrat where a king is blind, and can only be cured by
&ldquo;bathing his eyes in oil with a feather&rdquo; of a griffin that lives
on a high mountain. His third and youngest son catches and
brings him one of the griffins and the king regains his sight.</p>

<p>5. Winning the gratitude of a bird by killing the snake or
dragon that year after year devours its young birds is such
a common incident in fairy tales, that I will only mention
two instances. One occurs in a Din&aacute;jpur tale published by
Mr. G.&nbsp;H. Damant in the <i>Indian Antiquary</i> for 5th April,
1872, p. 145, where the hero saves the young birds from the
snake. They tell the old birds. He lies under the tree and
listens to the old birds relating how he will find the tree with
the silver stem and golden branches he has come to seek. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
other occurs at pp. 119, 110, of a story collected by Vogl
(<i>Volksmaerchen</i> [Slavonic], p. 79) called Sch&ouml;n-Jela. In this
tale the hero is sheltered in the dreadful underground wilderness
by a hermit. Here there is the gigantic bird, Einja,
who every third year has a brood of four young birds which a
dragon as regularly devours. The hero, Prince Milan, watches
by the nest for the dragon and kills him. The young birds,
overjoyed, fly out of the nest and cover the hero with their wings
till the old bird on her return asks who has saved them. Then
they unfold their wings and she sees Prince Milan. In return
she carries him to the upper world.</p>

<p>6. The word translated &ldquo;night-growing rice&rdquo; is R&aacute;t-vash&aacute;-ke-dh&aacute;n;
and the ayah&rsquo;s description of this rice is given in the
story. In this description she spoke of it as ch&aacute;wal, the common
word for uncooked rice, and said the Rakshas wished to drink
its k&aacute;nj&iacute;-p&aacute;n&iacute; (rice-water). As it is a fairy plant I am afraid
it is hopeless trying to find its botanical name. Unluckily, Dr.
George King says <i>vash&aacute;</i> is not rice at all. This is what he
wrote to me on the subject: &ldquo;<i>Vash&aacute;</i> is, I suppose, the same as
<i>vasaka</i>, and in that case is <i>Justitia Adhatoda</i>, a straggling
shrub common over the whole of India [very unlike the R&aacute;t-vash&aacute;-ke-dh&aacute;n]
and which was in the Sanscrit as it is in the native
pharmacop&oelig;ias. It is not a kind of rice, but belongs to the
natural order of Acanthace&aelig; (the family to which Acanthus and
Thunbergia belong).&rdquo; This night-growing rice may be compared
to the day-growing rice in paragraph 2, p. <a href="#Page_288">288</a>, of the notes to
this story.</p>

<p>7. Compare with the paper boat the rolled-up burdock leaf
given to the hero by the dwarf in the seventh Esthonian tale
quoted by Gubernatis (<i>Zoological Mythology</i>, vol. I. p. 155):
whenever this hero wishes to cross water he unrolls his burdock-leaf.
Gubernatis compares this leaf to the lotus-leaf on which
the Hind&uacute;s represented their god as floating in the midst of the
waters (<i>ibid.</i>).</p>

<p>8. With the great wind that comes from the demon, compare
the following Swedish account of a giant in Thorpe&rsquo;s <i>Northern
Mythology</i>, vol. II. p. 85. He asks his road of a lad, who directs
him: then &ldquo;he went off as in a whirlwind, and the lad now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>291]</a></span>
discovered, to his no small astonishment, that his forefinger with
which he had pointed out the way had followed along with the
giant.&rdquo; In the old Scandinavian belief the Giant Hr&aelig;svelgr
sat at the end of heaven in an eagle&rsquo;s garb (arna ham). From
the motion of his wings came the wind which passed over men
(<i>ib.</i> vol. I. p. 8). It must be mentioned also that &ldquo;in the German
popular tales the devil is frequently made to step into the
place of the giants&rdquo; (<i>ib.</i> vol. I. p. 234), and that St&ouml;pke or
Stepke is in Lower Saxony an appellation of the devil or of the
whirlwind, from which proceed the fogs which spread over the
land (<i>ib.</i> p. 235). The devil sits in the whirlwind and rushes
howling and raging through the air (Mark Sagen, <i>ib.</i> p. 377).
The whirlwind is also ascribed to witches. If a knife be cast
into it, the witch will be wounded and become visible (Schreiber&rsquo;s
Taschenbuch, 1839, p. 323; <i>ib.</i> vol. I. p. 235). Mr.
Ralston, in his <i>Songs of the Russian People</i>, p. 382, says the
Russian peasant attributes whirlwinds to the mad dances in
which the devil celebrates his marriage with a witch, and at
p. 155 of the same book tells us how the malicious demon Lyeshy
not only makes use of the whirlwind as a travelling conveyance
for himself and a means of turning intruders out of quarters he
had selected for his own refuge, but sends home in it people
to whom he is grateful. In Ireland we find a wind blowing
from hell. King Loegaire tells Patrick, &ldquo;I perceived the wind
cold, icy, like a two-ridged spear, which almost took our hair
from our heads and passed through us to the ground. I questioned
Ben&eacute;n as to this wind. Said Ben&eacute;n to me, &lsquo;This is the
wind of hell which has opened before C&uacute;chulainn.&rsquo;&rdquo; <i>Lebar na
huidre</i>, p. 113 a. This &ldquo;wind of hell&rdquo; makes one think of the
sweet-scented wind from the mid-day regions, and the evil-scented
wind from the north, which in old Persian religious
belief blew to meet pure and wicked souls after death (Tylor&rsquo;s
<i>Primitive Culture</i>, vol. II. pp. 98, 99). Mr. Tylor mentions also
the Fanti negroes&rsquo; belief that the men and animals they sacrifice
to the local fetish are carried away in a whirlwind imperceptibly
to the worshippers (<i>ib.</i> p. 378).</p>

<p>8. &Aacute;bjhamjham-ke p&aacute;n&iacute; is what has been translated by
&ldquo;water from the glittering well.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
9. The king had a great pit dug in the jungle. This is how
Kai and Bedwyr plucked out the beard of Dillus Varvawc,
which had to be plucked out during life. They made him eat
meat till he slept. &ldquo;Then Kai made a pit under his feet, the
largest in the world, and he struck him a violent blow, and
squeezed him into the pit. And there they twitched out his
beard completely with the wooden tweezers; and after that
they slew him altogether&rdquo; (&ldquo;Kilhwch and Olwen,&rdquo; <i>Mabinogion</i>,
vol. II. p. 304).</p>


<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nxxv" id="nxxv"></a>XXV.&mdash;THE FAN PRINCE.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxxv">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. The boat would not move because the king had forgotten
to get the thing his youngest daughter had asked him to bring
her. Signor de Gubernatis (<i>Zoological Mythology</i>, vol. II. p. 382)
mentions an unpublished story from near Leghorn in which
a sailor promises to bring his youngest daughter a rose. The
eldest daughter is to have a shawl, and the second a hat.
&ldquo;When the voyage is over, he is about to return, but having forgotten
the rose, the ship refuses to move; he is compelled to go
back to look for a rose in a garden; a magician hands the rose
with a little box to the father to give it to one of his daughters,
whom the magician is to marry. At midnight, the father, having
returned home, relates to his third daughter all that had happened.
The little box is opened; it carries off the third daughter
to the magician, who happens to be King Pietraverde, and is
now a handsome young man.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxxvi">To&nbsp;story</a></span>The merchant&rsquo;s son possibly was afraid of incurring the
wrath either of an original spirit residing in the tree, or of some
human soul who had been born again as its genius (see

paragraph 1, p. <a href="#Page_276">276</a>, of note to &ldquo;The fak&iacute;r N&aacute;naks&aacute; saves the
merchant&rsquo;s life&rdquo;). M&uacute;niy&aacute; could give no reason for his asking
each tree&rsquo;s permission to cut it down.</p>


<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nxxvii" id="nxxvii"></a>XXVII.&mdash;P&Aacute;NWPATT&Iacute; R&Aacute;N&Iacute;.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxxvii">To&nbsp;story</a></span>See another version of this tale in the Baital Pach&iacute;si, No. 1.

<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nxxviii" id="nxxviii"></a>XXVIII.&mdash;THE CLEVER WIFE.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxxviii">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. The merchant&rsquo;s wife tricks the four men into chests. Upakos&aacute;
makes the like appointments, and plays a similar trick:
compare her story translated from the Kath&aacute;p&iacute;tha by Dr. G.
B&uuml;hler in the <i>Indian Antiquary</i> for 4th October, 1872, pp. 305,
306: and in &ldquo;The Touchstone,&rdquo; a Din&aacute;jpur legend told by Mr.
G.&nbsp;H. Damant at p. 337 of the <i>Indian Antiquary</i> for December,
1873, the hero-prince&rsquo;s second wife, Pr&aacute;nn&aacute;sin&iacute;, in order to
regain the touchstone for her husband (like Upakos&aacute; and the
Clever Wife) makes appointments with, and then tricks, the
kotw&aacute;l, the king&rsquo;s councillor, the prime minister, and lastly the
king himself.</p>

<p>2. She plays cards (<i>t&aacute;s</i>). Forbes in his Hind&uacute;st&aacute;n&iacute; and English
Dictionary p. 543, says <i>t&aacute;s</i> is the word used for <em>Indian</em>
playing cards. The Indian pack, he says, contains eight suits,
each suit consisting of a king, waz&iacute;r, and ten cards having
various figures represented on them from one to ten in number.</p>

<p>[A close parallel to this tale is <i>Adi&rsquo;s Wife</i>, a Beng&aacute;li legend
from Dinagepore, told by the late Mr. Damant in the <i>Indian
Antiquary</i> for January, 1880, p. 2.]</p>

<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nxxix" id="nxxix"></a>XXIX.&mdash;R&Aacute;J&Aacute; HARICHAND&rsquo;S PUNISHMENT.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxxix">To&nbsp;story</a></span>1. This king is probably the same as &ldquo;The Upright King,&rdquo;
Harchand R&aacute;j&aacute;, p. <a href="#Page_68">68</a> of this collection.</p>

<p>2. The Kop Sh&aacute;stra. M&uacute;niy&aacute; says <i>kop</i> is a Hind&uacute;st&aacute;n&iacute;, not
a Beng&aacute;li word, and has nothing whatever to do with demons.
This is what Mr. Tawney writes on the subject: &ldquo;It might
mean <i>kapi</i>, or <i>kapila</i> if the woman is a Beng&aacute;li. <i>Kapi</i> is a
name of Vish&#7751;u, possibly it might be the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana as treating
of monkeys, but I really do not know. I see Monier Williams
says that there are certain demons called <i>kapa</i>. But of course
<i>k&oacute;pa</i> is anger. I suppose you know that the natives of Bengal
pronounce the short <i>a</i> as <i>o</i> in the English word <i>hop</i>.&rdquo; M&uacute;niy&aacute;
pronounces <i>kop</i> like the English word <i>cope</i>. This Sh&aacute;stra seems
as hopelessly mythical as the <i>R&aacute;t-vash&aacute;-ke-dh&aacute;n</i>.</p>


<h3 class="smlpadt"><a name="nxxx" id="nxxx"></a>XXX.&mdash;THE KING&rsquo;S SON AND THE WAZ&Iacute;R&rsquo;S
DAUGHTER.</h3>

<p><span class="link"><a href="#sxxx">To&nbsp;story</a></span>In a Servian story, &ldquo;Des Vaters letzter Wille,&rdquo; pp. 134, 135,
136, of the <i>Volksmaerchen der Serben</i> collected by Karadschitsch,
the youngest brother has to take his brother-in-law&rsquo;s horse over
a bridge under which he sees an immense kettle full of boiling
water in which men&rsquo;s heads are cooking while eagles peck at
them. He then passes through a village where all is song and
joyfulness because, so the inhabitants tell him, each year is
fruitful with them and they live, therefore, in the midst of plenty.
Then he sees two dogs quarrelling which he cannot succeed
in separating. He next passes through a village where all is
sorrow and tears because each year comes hail, so the inhabitants
&ldquo;have nothing.&rdquo; Next he sees two boars fighting together
and cannot separate them any more than he could part the
dogs. Lastly, he reaches a beautiful meadow. In the evening
his brother-in-law expounds the meaning of all he has seen.
The heads in the boiling vessel represent the everlasting torment
in the next world. The happy villagers are good, charitable
men, with whom God is well pleased. The dogs are his elder
brothers&rsquo; wives. The sorrowing villagers are men who know
neither righteousness, concord, nor God. The boars are his
two wicked elder brothers. The meadow is paradise.</p>

<p><b>Transcriber's Note</b></p>

<p>Printer errors (for example, omitted or transposed characters) have been
repaired, as have punctuation errors.</p>

<p>Variable spelling, hyphenation and use of accents are preserved as printed
in quoted material, but have otherwise been made consistent where there was
a clear prevalence of one form over the other.</p>

<p>Some of the spelling of Hindi words vary from modern spelling, and
these have been preserved as printed. There is also some variation
within the text&mdash;for example, dhall is used in the text while the
glossary shows D&aacute;l. These are also preserved as printed.</p>

<p>There are some discrepancies between the title of stories as given in the
index and main text, and in the notes at the end. These have been preserved
as printed.</p>

<p>Alphabetic links have been added at the beginning of the index, for ease
of navigation. Errors in page references in the index have been repaired.</p>
